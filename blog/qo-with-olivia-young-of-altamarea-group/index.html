        <p class="byline">09/12/2013</p>
      
      <p>Today I’m speaking with Olivia Young, Head of Media &amp; Communications for <a href="http://www.altamareagroup.com/">Altamarea Group</a>, whose restaurants include Ai Fiori, Osteria Morini, and Marea, to name a few.​</p>

      <p>During her career with Altamarea Group, Olivia has brought their media efforts in-house, and now oversees the group’s nine restaurants worldwide.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: WHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR BRANDS IN THE CULINARY INDUSTRY?</p>

<p>Olivia Young: Differentiation. Brands in the culinary industry tend to be focused on a chef or person because they’re so identifiable. Then those people physically expand beyond the restaurant with product lines, whether it’s pots and pans, home-ware lines, etc. That’s a large part of defining a culinary brand.</p>

<p>As far as differentiating yourself in the restaurant category, there’s a migration toward really fantastic food- whether you’re creating a luxury dining experience or launching a food truck and creating a brand around that.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: I THINK THIS WHOLE FOOD TRUCK TREND IS SO INTERESTING. IT OPENS UP THE CULINARY WORLD FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN’T CULINARY EXPERTS OR HAVEN’T EXPERIENCED FINE DINING– SINCE WE’RE FOCUSED ON LUXURY HERE, WHAT’S YOUR TAKE ON FOOD TRUCKS?</p>

<p>Olivia: Food trucks make exciting food accessible to the average consumer who might not have the desire or the means for fine dining. They also give chefs from fine dining backgrounds the ability to do something a little more fun or experimental with their skill.</p>

<p>There’s been a curve in the food truck trend. Chefs started these trucks and they were huge in Southern California, Miami and New York. Now, because they’ve become so wildly popular and received enough funding, they’re expanding into brick-and-mortar. It’s a cool concept, and it allows chefs to do something that’s more fundamental and requires less capital. It’s also about accessibility– it gives consumers the ability to try something that they couldn’t necessarily afford before.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: WHAT COMES UP A LOT IN THESE Q&amp;O CONVERSATIONS IS THE “EXPERIENCE” – HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR A CONSUMER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A BRAND IS ALL ABOUT. WHAT’S INTERESTING ABOUT THE FOOD TRUCK CRAZE IS THAT EVERYONE’S STANDING ON LINE, AND THERE’S PROBABLY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE TRUCK AND THE FOOD. IT’S MORE INTERACTIVE THAN SITTING AND LOOKING AT A MENU.</p>

<p>Olivia: In light of luxury, these trucks are serving artisanal products from a truck which seems so “rear-history”, but it’s also very luxurious. You can stand in line at Wafels &amp; Dinges for a waffle that’s covered in Speculoos paste or fresh fruit with cream because you want a really luxurious waffle—you don’t want to just make an Eggo waffle in your toaster. There’s an enormous difference.</p>

<p>In light of Fashion Week, even fashion or designer parties have gotten into the craze. Instead of paying for catering, food trucks are a cheaper and trendier option to satiate the partygoer’s palette.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: WHICH BRANDS IN YOUR CATEGORY WOULD YOU CATEGORIZE AS “BEST IN CLASS”, AS COHESIVE THROUGHOUT THE BRAND EXPERIENCE?</p>

<p>Olivia: When it comes to a cohesive experience from the moment you walk in, I’m drawn to Hillstone Restaurant Group. You walk in and everyone appears friendly and poised, they’re dressed casually but very well. I’m confident in saying that every meal I have had at Hillstone is almost the same. Is it luxury? To me, that’s luxury.​</p>

      <h1>If you can pay for an experience that's as expensive as a New York Times starred restaurant and consistently excellent, there's luxury involved in that.</h1>

    <div class="text-section">
      <p><strong>ORIT</strong>: OUTSIDE OF YOUR CATEGORY, CAN YOU THINK OF A BRAND THAT YOU WOULD CALL BEST IN CLASS?</p>

<p>Olivia: In the fresh pressed juice category, Juice Press is clearly best in class. The staff is welcoming, the packaging is well branded, and the quality of the product is beyond any other company. They have locations all over Manhattan, which makes it easily accessible, and they deliver. While the price is a bit high, it’s worth it. They make the experience fun and enjoyable. Health nuts can be too intense, or take themselves too seriously. The Juice Press experience (and product) just makes you want to drink juice!</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THE SUCCESS OF A BRAND IN THE CULINARY OR RESTAURANT INDUSTRY?</p>

<p>Olivia: Quality of service and product, strong internal leadership, great management and having employees who love what they do and convey that to the customer.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FOOD TRUCK MOVEMENT EARLIER, BUT WHAT’S NEW, WHAT’S HAPPENING WITH RESTAURANTS OR HOSPITALITY BRANDS RIGHT NOW?</p>

<p>Olivia: It went from food trucks and comfort foods, to locally grown produce to the “How close can I get to the fish I’m eating tonight?” concept.</p>

<p>What I’m seeing in New York City is that chefs are returning to doing what they love. Harold Dieterle opened a German-Italian restaurant, The Marrow, that goes back to his heritage. I don’t know if it’s a “trend” that these chefs who were lauded for what they did are now opening places that really cater to what they love—they’re just cooking what they like to eat. Even Chef Michael White went back to his roots with retro-supperclub The Butterfly, cooking classic American style food paired with cocktails.</p>

<p>On a simple level, the luxury of fine dining is all about the product, so there’s a huge fixation on purveyors. Altamarea Group has been approached recently by companies that are aimed at making local available on a larger scale. These companies are making local sourcing possible on a mass digital scale; they offer chefs the ability to buy meat from the local farm of their choosing, for example. It’s like e-commerce for local foods. It’s an involved process, but it’s worth it for the restaurant and chefs because you know where you’re getting every single product, and that’s seriously luxurious.</p>

<p>When you look conversely at someplace like London when it comes to dining, they’ve gone off in a totally different direction. Their fixation is restaurants that just serve one thing. There’s a place called Bubble Dogs; they only serve hot dogs and champagne. There’s another place called Burger &amp; Lobster, and that’s it- you can only choose between a burger or lobster! Luxurious simplicity, I guess. Why not?</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: YOU KNOW, I’VE TRAVELED ALL OVER, AND THE FOOD IN LONDON WAS NEVER MEMORABLE, THEY GET A REALLY BAD RAP FOR FOOD.</p>

<p>Olivia: They do, but I have had two of the best meals I’ve ever had in London. They’ve really picked up the pace.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: WHERE WERE THOSE MEALS?</p>

<p>Olivia: At Heston Blumenthal’s at the Mandarin Oriental in Hyde Park &amp; tapas at Barrafina in Soho.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: THIS TREND THAT YOU’VE SEEN OF ONE OR TWO MENU CHOICES—HAS THAT HAPPENED IN THE U.S. AS WELL?</p>

<p>Olivia: I think Americans are obsessed with options, and we’re not simple enough to embrace it. Here in New York there’s PDT (Please Don’t Tell), which has cocktails and hotdogs from Crif Dogs served at a super exclusive bar.</p>

<p>In Paris there’s Le Relais de l’Entrecôte where all they serve is steak frites. I think that would be a wonderful concept to recreate in NYC with super high quality meat. People would love that, but there would have to be a way to serve top quality and avoid premium prices. Do I think that trend is here right now? Not really. Even someplace like Shake Shack has options, and that’s considered rather simple. I think as a society we enjoy that luxury.</p>

<p>ORIT: WHAT ARE CUSTOMERS EXPECTING OF THESE LUXURY RESTAURANT BRANDS?</p>

<p>Olivia: When it comes to paying money for food, there are so many options and it’s so expensive. It has to be a really wonderful experience beyond the food.​</p>

    <div class="text-section">
      <p>Consumer research and the Internet has allowed companies to research and store data to create consumer profiles—it makes the consumer’s experience even more luxurious due to personalization. While it’s not necessarily professional to greet a person by name the first time they visit, it’s certainly nice to let them know you remember them upon their return. Customer profiles list preferences, special occasions, dietary restrictions, but the experience is also about the added touch: remembering the wine they drank, the dessert they loved. It’s about making that person feel important and special, making them feel that they’ve spent their money well, because they could have gone anywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: RIGHT, BECAUSE THE FOOD CAN BE AMAZING, BUT IF THE HOSPITALITY’S NOT THERE, IT CANCELS EVERYTHING ELSE OUT.</p>

<p>Olivia: Of the last couple of unbelievable dining experiences I had, I probably recall two of the 25 courses I ate. It was the entire experience that was phenomenal, including the company I was with.</p>

<p>It also has to be kept in mind in the hospitality experience that the employees really have to love where they’re working and whom they’re working for, because that’s immediately apparent to the customer. So if you’re the manager of the restaurant and you’re having a bad day, and you open your mouth and explode at the customer, that’s it. You’ve ruined the experience, and they’ll never come back there and they’ll tell others. As opposed to walking into Celine for a handbag: you can greet me and tell me how beautiful the bag is, but I walked in knowing that. The experience is more objective in retail. On the other hand, if I’m sitting down for a four-star meal, spending the time and paying $400 a head, I want to be treated like a queen for as long as I’m seated.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: WHAT ARE THE STANDOUT HOSPITALITY BRANDS BRINGING TO THE “TABLE”?</p>

<p>Olivia: Luxury and consistency. If I could talk about my own group for a moment, it’s important to maintain the luxury status of a brand. We do so by constant R+D at Altamarea Group locations, but also outside of the group. My CEO eats at AMG restaurants constantly and offers nonstop feedback. It’s an ongoing conversation. That said, our obsession with luxurious and consistent experiences parlays to our customer.</p>

<p>We’re building the Altamarea Group brand so that people can go to Nicoletta for pizza and a beer, or go to Marea for extravagant caviar and oysters, and know that they’re going to have a wonderful experience regardless of price point. The idea expands to London and Hong Kong as well, with Al Molo and Chop Shop—customers know and trust the AMG brand, and it not only makes them feel closer to home, but takes some of the risk out of going to a restaurant in a foreign city. It’s that guaranteed consistency of experience that goes into building a luxury brand.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: WE’VE TOUCHED ON THIS A FEW TIMES—EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE, WHAT’S THE SECRET? DOES AMG HAVE A SECRET FORMULA?</p>

<p>Olivia: Altamarea Group began because the former president of Merrill Lynch, Ahmass Fakahany, made a career change. He left finance for his love of restaurants, made an investment and partnered with Chef Michael White. Altamarea was founded by a serious passion for the industry. That passion, it trickles down to the headquarters, where there are likeminded people who love the company and industry. From there, the employees at the restaurant are not only well trained by top managers, but the managers are well trained by the CEO. Ahmass meets with each manager every single week to make sure there’s no disconnect between the property and upper management. In meeting with the managers, chefs, waiters, he empowers employees to share the vision he’s creating for the company, and shares his hope of expanding the company and brand globally, with great product and great people.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: I’VE NOTICED YOU HAVE PEOPLE FROM THE AMG FAMILY THAT ROTATE AMONG YOUR RESTAURANTS. TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT.</p>

<p>Olivia: Our turnover as a group is so much lower than the industry standard, because our corporate culture is all about employees enjoying what they do. Someone who begins as a sous chef or a line cook can grow to become a chef at multiple properties within Altamarea. There’s no reason for them to go elsewhere because AMG is expanding rapidly and there’s opportunity for personal growth.</p>

<p>Ahamass, Chef Michael White and upper management are all so interested in what everybody wants to do and where they see themselves in the future. We don’t see it as hiring a waiter, we see it as hiring someone who will serve and work at AMG for an unforeseeable amount of time.</p>

<p><strong>ORIT</strong>: LASTLY, WHAT ARE YOUR PERSONAL LUXURIES?</p>

<p>Olivia: A $40 spin class at Soul Cycle, a boxing trainer, Juice Press, an unbelievable pair of shoes, a meal at the French Laundry, staying at the Savoy in London, too much Laurent Perrier Rose Champagne—things that are instantaneous or that leave lasting memories. I think everybody should indulge, and cost isn’t a qualifier of indulgence.​</p>
