  In an ongoing effort to identify high-performing B2B service providers
  throughout the globe, Clutch recently issued a report releasing their most
  updated research of the best agencies and developers in New York City. Clutch,
  a ratings and reviews platform for service providers, has profiled and
  evaluated thousands of companies belonging to a wide range of industries,
  including IT services and development, advertising and marketing, social media
  marketing and SEO, and most importantly, branding


  Their segment devoted to branding is one of the most extensive and competitive
  listings on their site, with some of the country’s strongest agencies vying
  for the position as the top provider for buyers seeking branding services. For
  this reason, The O Group is incredibly proud and excited to announce that
  Clutch has featured us as one of the best branding agencies in New York in
  2017.

      To receive this distinction, The O Group had to prove ourselves as a
      strong and results-driven agency as determined by a few different factors.
      First, Clutch measured our presence in the branding market by looking at
      the clients we serve, the branding services we offer, and our ability to
      deliver quality projects as showcased by the
      [c](https://www.ogroup.net/work/)ase studies displayed on our website.


      Next, and most significantly, Clutch analysts spoke directly with our
      former and current clients to generate reviews for The O Group, all of
      which can be accessed through our Clutch profile. In creating these
      reviews, Clutch interviewed our clients with detailed and purposeful
      questions aimed at understanding how we’ve partnered with them and what
      sort of outcomes our work has produced.


      These reviews, combined with our branding expertise, is what has led to
      our placement on Clutch, giving us the opportunity to see how we rank
      compared to similar firms. So far, so good.


      Without our clients, The O Group would not be where it is today. We are
      greatly appreciative of the partnerships we’ve maintained over the years
      and could not be more proud of what we’ve accomplished together. Moving
      forward, we will continue delivering quality work for our clients so we
      can not only maintain the success we’ve had as an agency, but also
      continue rising on Clutch’s platform until we have the spot at the top of
      their New York and Seattle coverage and beyond.
