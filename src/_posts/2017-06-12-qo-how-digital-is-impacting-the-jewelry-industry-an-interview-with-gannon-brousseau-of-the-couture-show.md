      Gannon spent the first 15 years of his career in LA, primarily in retail
      industries, before making the transition to both New York City and the
      world of fine jewelry.





      **ORIT**: I'M SEEING A LITTLE ACTION FROM COUTURE ON INSTAGRAM! WHAT'S
      HAPPENING THERE?





      Gannon Brousseau: I hope you are seeing more than a little! Yes,
      "#CoutureTakeOver"! It's a concept we launched in October and are really
      excited about. I haven't been involved with the jewelry industry long but
      I don't think one needs to be to see how much opportunity there is with
      this industry. I'm a big fan of the fashion industry and have long admired
      how well they've been able to embrace social media and use it to drive
      consumer engagement and brand loyalty.





      In fashion they have a collective voice actively engaging the consumer, and
      in our industry we don't and I feel we should. It makes perfect sense for
      Couture to be that unifying voice. We picked Instagram as a launching point
      for this effort because it's purely visual and primarily mobile; it's also
      a very easy medium for people to understand. We launched #CoutureTakeOver
      in October with Irene Neuwirth and were incredibly excited by the
      response.





      **ORIT**: SO WHAT COMES AFTER IRENE?





      Gannon: After Irene took us on a three day journey of Los Angeles, Kara
      Ross gave us a behind the scenes look at the opening of her first flagship
      on Madison Avenue. December marked our first retailer #CoutureTakeOver, as
      Jennifer McCurry of Marissa Collections welcomed us into her life as
      a jewelry buyer. In January, we're really excited to have had our first
      editor, Danielle Miele of Gem Gossip, host #CoutureTakeOver.

      <br>We all know what people "do" in the jewelry industry, but not many of
      us get to see behind the scenes and live life through that person's eyes;
      especially the consumer. This is of great interest to me and by the
      reactions we have received from our community; it is of great interest to
      them as well.





      **ORIT**: WHAT'S THE GOAL OF COUTURE TAKEOVER?





      Gannon: The goal is really two-fold. The first is to inspire our industry
      to better engage social media. The second and ultimately the most important
      goal is to create a dialogue with the consumer. Our industry has been
      around since the beginning of time and tends to be slow adopters of
      technology. I am hoping that once they see the power of social media, they
      will become active participants and add to the conversation.





      **ORIT**: WHAT MAKES FOR A SUCCESSFUL BRAND?





      Gannon: Successful brands in any industry seem to have a few things in
      common: they know who they are, they know who their customer is, and
      everything they do feeds that understanding and vision. I am a firm
      believer that you can't be everything to everyone, and the most successful
      brands understand that.





      **ORIT**: HOW ARE BRANDS DRIVING ENGAGEMENT?





      Gannon: Brands are getting much more creative and are really embracing
      social media in wonderful ways. Instagram and Tumblr are becoming more and
      more powerful in the luxury space.​

      Social media has given the consumer a very powerful voice and I think it is
      wonderful because it has happened so organically.





      This movement hasn't been driven by brands, but brands have taken notice,
      and have recognized that hashtags like "#WIWT" (What I Wore Today) and
      #showmeyourrings are as important to their brand as pages in major
      publications. The most creative brands have begun to identify social media
      influencers and have started to bring them "inside" their establishments.
      It has completely broken down former barriers between brands and consumers.
      That philosophy feeds into everything we're doing with CoutureTakeOver.





      **ORIT**: SO WHAT DO YOU FEEL MAKES FOR A SUCCESSFUL CROSS INDUSTRY
      COLLABORATION?





      Gannon: I think collaboration across industries is critical, and I applaud
      any brand looking for different opportunities to reach their customer.
      Anytime a brand can identify synergies across the aisle, they build a much
      more diverse luxury universe.





      **ORIT**: SO TALK TO US ABOUT THE WORLD OF E-COMMERCE IN THE JEWELRY
      INDUSTRY, WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES FOR BRANDS ENTERING THAT SPACE?





      Gannon: This is the topic of many conversations around the office. Like
      anything else, there are definite challenges with e-commerce—upfront costs
      of building a site, establishing a clear return policy, fulfilling orders,
      driving traffic to your site, customer service, protecting oneself from
      fraud, etc. Additionally, there is a romance involved in selling jewelry
      that requires someone to be able to touch and feel the product, and the
      impulse shopping inherent in e-commerce doesn't often apply to fine
      jewelry. All of that said, e-commerce can work, and there is definitely an
      opportunity to expand the way we present and/or shop for jewelry, but
      before this can occur, our industry needs to create a better dialogue with
      our consumers.





      **ORIT**: HOW DO BRANDS STAND OUT IN SUCH A CROWDED SPACE?





      Gannon: All spaces are crowded and it's the brands that are finding new and
      creative ways of reaching and activating their audiences that are
      innovative. These brands understand that every aspect of who they are must
      point in the same direction and tell the same story. They understand that
      the designer, the marketing team, the sales people, etc. are all an
      extension of the story that brand is telling.​

      Tom Ford understood this early on and made sure everyone at Gucci
      represented his vision of what that brand was. But above all else, he made
      sure that he himself embodied his vision of the brand and exuded that
      vision in everything that he did. It was incredibly calculated and
      absolutely brilliant. There is an incredible opportunity for the jewelry
      industry to embrace this same way of thinking.





      **ORIT**: AS A DESIGNER, HOW CAN YOU CONTROL THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE ONCE
      THAT PRODUCT LEAVES YOUR STUDIO FOR A RETAILER?





      Gannon: It's important for a designer to have a clear grasp of who they are
      and what they are, their Brand DNA so to speak. This applies to all aspects
      of their brand, from their logo to their fixtures to their actual product,
      everything must tell the same story. Once a designer has thoroughly defined
      who they are, they must provide a clear presentation of their brand to
      their retail partners so that the retailer understands who they are and how
      the brand should be presented, leaving no room for interpretation.





      Education and consistency are critical to building a brand inside of the
      retail space. Continually communicating with your retailers is key to
      keeping your brand's story top-of-mind. This communication must extend
      beyond the retail buyer to all of the sales associates since they are the
      ones on the front line with the consumer.





      **ORIT**: WHAT ARE YOUR PERSONAL LUXURIES?





      Gannon: TSA pre-check!





      **ORIT**: SERIOUSLY?!





      Gannon: Yes, I HATE waiting in line!





      **ORIT**: IF I SAID TO YOU TOMORROW YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT, WHAT
      WOULD YOU DO?





      Gannon: Honestly, I'd wander the streets of New York with my fianc&eacute;.
      New York is such an inspiring city, and sometimes the best plans are to
      have no plans and to stumble onto something organically.
