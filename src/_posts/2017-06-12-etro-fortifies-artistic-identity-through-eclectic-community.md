      "The ‘Circle of Poets’ concept seems to mimic the brand’s foundation as
      a business run and closely held by a family," said Tina Masciadrelli,
      client services director at The O Group, New York.

      "The concept brings together a group of the most talented people to
      highlight incredible work in the art world—echoing the Etro mindset that
      the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Allowing consumers to
      engage and participate with the brand is necessary for both growth and
      relevance. By inviting user-generated content, Etro is able to tap into the
      lifestyle of their most loyal consumers and identify what inspires them and
      what might keep them coming back to the brand."
