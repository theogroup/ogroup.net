      "The Boston Consulting Group recently announced its prediction that luxury
      sales growth will slow to single digits over the next 10 years. Strong
      sales figures from China have played a huge part in the industry’s near
      double-digit growth year-over-year for the past decade. With Asian luxury
      consumers reeling in their spending, and luxury consumers holding steady
      throughout the rest of the world, BCG posits a modest 4 percent growth
      figure well into the year 2020.





      We certainly are not ready to panic. After all, any growth is good. That
      said, there are plenty of ways that luxury brands can help themselves
      during lean or slow growth periods."
