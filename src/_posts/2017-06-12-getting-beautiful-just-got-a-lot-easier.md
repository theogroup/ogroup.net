      Nowadays you can do just about anything in a few clicks, especially in New
      York City. You Seamless your food (not ashamed to admit I’ve ordered coffee
      from the bodega downstairs to my office), you can have wine delivered in
      under an hour, and you can have someone pick up and deliver you your dry
      cleaning.

      Finally the beauty world is catching up.

      Beautified offers appointment-based salon services (haircuts, blowouts,
      massages, facials, waxes) in a matter of clicks.&nbsp;[Not only can you can
      get a killer facial on-demand, you can also book at top studios like
      Barry’s Bootcamp and Flywheel totally last
      minute](http://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/hannah-bronfmans-app-now-makes-booking-workouts-and-waxes-super-easy/).
      Plus, you might get a deal. Score!​

      **WCW: Hannah Bronfman**

      DJ, influencer, entrepreneur, fitness guru and Beautified Co-founder Hannah
      Bronfman is totally my girl crush. She’s the friend with advice you never
      knew you needed. Via Beautified she has introduced me to the antioxidant
      powers of Matcha tea, showed me where to take Beyonc&eacute; themed dance
      classes in the city and extolled the virtues of those trendy sheet masks.

      An inspiring motivator in her own right, she preaches a much-needed ‘be the
      best version of yourself’ mantra while leading strategy for brand
      integration and partnerships for Beautified.

      Hannah has stuck out to me as a real voice for a new generation of creators
      and leaders. There is a real genuineness about her, and brands are taking
      note. Clinique tapped her as an ambassador in their #FaceForward campaign
      and Adidas features Bronfman as part of their 2016 #HereToCreate
      campaign.​

  - text_markdown: "For me Hannah adds a much-needed human quality to Beautified’s stellar product offering.\n\n**Haircuts you can actually trust&nbsp;**\n\nTHIS is where Beautified really adds value. Does this scenario sound familiar? \"Okay, you’re all done!\" \"Wow! I love it..\" \\*Panic, cries, calls best friend, runs home and fixes weird new hair style and part.\\*\n\nBad haircuts, be gone. You can rest assured that any stylist and salon you visit is top quality. You’re only served salons that \"an insider, editor or an influencer has visited.\" You don’t have to take your chances with Yelp, or the eyebrow place on the corner. Consumers, myself included, expect a certain level of transparency, service and reliability from brands. Service-based beauty brands, like Glamsquad, Priv, and Beautified, are no different.​"

      **Seamless Transactions.**

      Another one of my favorite features? You pay for your entire service (and
      tip!) through the app. No more awkward loitering at the counter, no more
      fumbling for cash.

      While pre-paying online and through apps has become the norm, beauty salons
      are often far behind. So this feature of the app was an unexpected, and
      much appreciated, value-add for me. I’ve been able to enjoy my appointments
      (and complimentary beverage) more knowing that I’m up and out the door as
      soon as I get up from my chair.​

      **Beautified gives good (inter)face**

      Not only is the pure functionality of this app a godsend, but the interface
      design is on point too. Working in the world of branding, I’m partial to
      great design. In the luxury creative space, less is more. Beautified does
      not disappoint. All in all, the app is beautiful, simple and easy-to-use.

      **Go ahead girl, get Beautified**

      All you need to #getbeautified is download the app. Right now it’s only
      available for iOS (sorry not sorry Android) and only available in New York
      City.

      Warning: Beautified is highly addictive. Weekly massages, blowouts and
      workouts have been known to occur. Beautified may also cause euphoria and
      increased spending. Users are advised to exercise caution when walking
      around SoHo post-haircut as you may feel more fabulous than usual.​
