      We culled a number of luxury lessons while perusing its latest edition…









      **Entertain and Be Positive.**









      Copy and imagery should be tailored for optimism and to promote feeling
      good. Supplement the experience with a special extra - whether it be
      exclusive photography or golden tidbits on designers, brands or
      manufacturing processes. Luxury is meant to be enjoyed.









      **Look beyond Price.**









      The Christmas Book features products priced from less than $50 to a $1.5
      million rose gold private jet. Regardless of price, all of its offerings
      are undeniably luxurious.









      **Appeal to the Imagination.**









      Consider the individual client or customer. How would each live with your
      product or service? Are you inspiring others to envision the transformation
      of their own lives upon exposure to your brand? Develop a sensory
      experience to transport audiences through sight (and/or sound). Through the
      use of only one or two senses, they should almost smell, touch or taste
      what you have to offer. You’re not just presenting potential purchases,
      you’re presenting a lifestyle. Imagery should be potent and multifaceted to
      stimulate the imagination.









      **Be Attentive.**









      If luxury is revered for anything, it’s impeccable service. Neiman Marcus
      goes above and beyond with a live 24/7 chat feature for its holiday
      catalog. This is the core of the luxury experience and savvy shoppers
      expect nothing less.









      **Represent Diversity.**









      Why does The Christmas Book remain the topic on everyone’s lips? They don’t
      neglect their customers. You’ll find models representing a myriad of
      ethnicities and age groups in the catalog.









      **Give Back.**









      Altruism is a key asset for any business. If shoppers are investing serious
      sums of money, do your part by giving back. Neiman Marcus paves the way
      with exciting philanthropical missions with the purchase of each fantasy
      gift. Their efforts range from matching $25 Akola Project bracelet
      purchases with donations of the same amount to donations of tens of
      thousands of dollars to the Grammy Foundation and their own organization,
      The Heart of Neiman Marcus Foundation.









      **Exceed Expectations.**









      Anticipate clients’ wants and wishes, then elevate them beyond anything
      they’ve ever imagined. Meticulously attend to every last detail. The aim
      isn’t simply fulfilling a need but improving upon it until it evolves into
      something much more significant.









      90 years of global success is no small feat, yet The Christmas Book
      continues to wow audiences. Come up with a series of actionable steps to
      put these principles into play before the holidays. They’re the essential
      ingredients for a memorable experience, leading customer service and
      unwavering brand loyalty.​
