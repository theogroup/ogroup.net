intro_markdown: "I've been thinking a lot lately about how brands are continuing to invest or reinvest in the catalog portion of their business because of the correlating uptick in sales (as has the Wall Street Journal): Restoration Hardware (with a whopping 13 volume mailing), Bonobos, J. Crew.​"

      The move runs almost parallel to the trend of businesses that launched
      exclusively via e-commerce turning to pop-ups, fit shops, or true
      brick-and-mortar locations to continue to grow their brands (e.g. Everlane,
      Birch Box, Bauble Bar, Ayr).





      The common thread? We're human, and we like to hold things in our hands (be
      it a catalog or product). Especially it seems, if it's something of quality
      that we want to purchase. It's just one part of the whole of an effective
      brand experience.​

      I came across a great example the other day. Enter&nbsp;[Best
      Made](http://www.bestmadeco.com/), founded in 2009 with a single mission:
      make a high quality artisanal axe in Maine, paint it in NYC, sell online.
      They've since expanded into other outdoors-oriented products as well as
      launched a brick-and-mortar store in Tribeca, but stayed true to their
      original mission of delivering top-notch quality to men who want the tools
      and clothing necessary to connect to the outdoors (or at least display the
      appropriate accouterment in their homes). For a really visceral portrait of
      the in-store experience, I'll direct you to a&nbsp;[NYT
      article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/fashion/best-made-store-opens-in-manhattan.html?_r=0)&nbsp;that
      could also be described as a city dweller's love letter to the trappings of
      "getting back to the land."





      I was passed the latest Best Made catalog the other day by a colleague. As
      I felt the smooth, matte paper and the weight of the book I knew there was
      something wonderful inside. Beautiful images of the team and people they
      cross paths with exploring the outdoors (while testing product) flood
      pages, paired with short stories about various excursions and product
      origin.​

      Straight from the catalogue, "This jacket is as much at home in the
      backwoods as it is on Broadway; it's a timeless number that checks all the
      right boxes: American-made waxed cotton, English moleskin collar…"





      It's a full exploration of all that the Best Made brand means, and it's the
      perfect format to let you really hunker down and enjoy. Then of course, you
      can stop into the Tribeca store, check out their website (or both), and
      finally purchase that axe you'll definitely use on that trip to Alaska
      you've been planning for the last five years…​
