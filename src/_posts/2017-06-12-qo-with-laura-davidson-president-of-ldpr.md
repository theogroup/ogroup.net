      **LDPR**





      For more than 20 years LDPR has been at the vanguard of the travel public
      relations industry, constantly stretching the traditional boundaries of PR.
      Today LDPR's client list includes destinations like Scotland; hospitality
      groups like Aman Resorts and Rocco Forte Hotels; luxury resorts like
      Curtain Bluff (Antigua) and Gleneagles in Scotland; and prestigious tour
      companies such as Abercrombie & Kent and Sanctuary Retreats. We've had the
      pleasure of working with LDPR on the launch of Kittitian Hill, and we're
      looking forward to sharing the work we've done together soon. So, let's get
      into it!





      **ORIT**: WHAT GETS YOU OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING?





      **Laura Davidson**: My kids! And my travel world. There's always going to
      be news from somewhere around the world where I have a client, and it makes
      every day fascinating.





      **ORIT**: WOULD YOU CONSIDER LDPR MORE OF A BOUTIQUE AGENCY?





      **Laura**: Yes, and it's not by accident. When I went out on my own
      I wanted to control what I did, and the types of clients I work with.





      Most agencies our size are focused on growth, and among those there are
      some that have grown so fast they've lost quality and integrity. For me
      quality and integrity are critical part of staying this size, but it's also
      about being involved.





      For Kittitian Hill, for example, I'm doing my own press trip with two
      journalists I've worked with in the trade for 20 years – and if I were
      running a big business that opportunity just wouldn't exist.





      **ORIT**: IS THERE A COMMON CHALLENGE THAT LUXURY BRANDS BRING TO LDPR?





      **Laura**: The challenge for luxury travel brands, quite simply, is to
      create an experience. Anyone can provide great amenities. That's the
      driving force for both brand and agency – how to communicate that unique
      offering through every touch point, within and outside of a brand.​

      **ORIT**: FOR HOTELS IT'S ALL ABOUT REMAINING RELEVANT, EVEN WHEN YOUR
      CLIENT ISN'T ACTIVELY SEARCHING, RIGHT?





      **Laura**: For luxury hotels, it's about balancing the brand image with the
      need to drive business in the off-season. Luxury hotel brands have more
      competition than ever, and it's up to us to find the differentiators, the
      interesting story angles, and the signature services that will pop with the
      media.





      Aman Resorts is a new client at LDPR, and an incredibly strong luxury
      brand—their clients ("Aman Junkies") follow the resorts around the world.
      Even they have more competition this year with emerging luxury brands. The
      challenge is to tell their story through incredible photography and
      journalist first-person essays, as well as capitalize on the brand equity
      that has floated them to the top of the list for many years.





      **ORIT**: WHAT DO YOU FEEL HAS BEEN THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT RECENT
      SHIFT IN THE TRAVEL PR INDUSTRY?





      **Laura**: The digital revolution. It makes everything instantaneous, makes
      the world so much smaller, and it also makes our jobs 24/7!





      Another shift has been financial accountability. After the recession
      everyone was expected to do more with less, and it never went back. PR is
      now directly related to sales and the bottom line, where it used to be more
      about image and influence. When you do it right you can more than justify
      the expense, but the pressure is always on.





      Lastly, it's the constant focus on the millennial generation. Just as this
      group requires instant gratification, PR is expected to match that with
      instant results from digital promotions. It's a different way of thinking
      and requires us to strategize a more integrated approach. (That's when
      I tap into my millennial mentors at LDPR :))





      **ORIT**: HOW ARE TRAVEL BRANDS TAKING ON THE CHALLENGE OF SPEAKING TO
      MILLENNIALS?





      **Laura**: I think Marriott is a good example here. They're a strong brand,
      but they're also perceived as more traditional. I think the best thing they
      did was bring on a marketing leader (David Beebe) from outside of the
      travel industry to inspire out of the box thinking. "In recent years,
      Marriott has made aggressive moves to appeal to the next generation
      traveler who wants to stay at a well-designed hotel with social lobbies
      where they can work and play and rooms with the latest technology. In
      addition to AC Hotels, Marriott has been rolling out EDITION, a luxury
      lifestyle brand with renowned hotelier Ian Schrager, who's often credited
      with creating the boutique hotel concept. The company has also partnered
      with the Swedish IKEA furniture company to launch Moxy, a budget chain in
      Europe." (Source)





      The Marriott brand changed the way they're reaching out to millennials and
      developing new brands. Whether they will be successful or not we'll have to
      see, but I give them a lot of credit for shifting their strategy.&nbsp;





      **ORIT**: TELL US ABOUT A MOMENT OF SURPRISING SUCCESS WITH A CLIENT.





      **Laura**: Shetland ponies in sweaters. It's one of those crazy,
      spontaneous PR moments. Our client VisitScotland found a lovely woman named
      Doreen in the Shetland Islands and had her knit sweaters for two adorable
      ponies. We promoted this in the middle of a very cold U.S. winter. The
      video and images went viral; they were everywhere from CNN to New York
      magazine. It was crazy!





      **ORIT**: BEFORE I LET YOU GO, IS THERE AN OPENING YOU'RE HEARING A LOT OF
      BUZZ ABOUT IN 2015?





      **Laura**: I'm really curious about Amazon's announcement that they're
      going to go into the travel industry (Amazon to Get Into Hotel Booking With
      Launch of Travel Site).





      To me it's the most fascinating news, because when you think about Amazon's
      tracking and targeting capabilities, they could be really potent in travel.
      They can provide information at every medium- from television shows to
      local authors to product – related to the destination you're researching.
      It's a next level.​
