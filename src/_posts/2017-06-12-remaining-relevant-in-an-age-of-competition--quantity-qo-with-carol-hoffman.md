      A powerhouse in the fashion world, her 35-year career in the industry has
      been luxury product driven, with her particular expertise being in product
      analysis.





      **ORIT**: WHAT CHALLENGES DO YOU SEE LUXURY BRANDS FACING TODAY?





      Carol Hoffman: Coming from a retail and product analyst point of view—it's
      a critical challenge for luxury brands to stay relevant when there's so
      much product available. Whether a consumer walks the floor of
      a brick-and-mortar or surfs the web, it's easy to be overwhelmed. The
      brand's internal challenge is to make sure they're connecting emotionally
      with the client.





      **ORIT**: THAT EMOTIONAL CONNECTION MEANING THE ENTIRE BRAND EXPERIENCE?





      Carol: Years ago everything was about the 3 P's: Product, Presentation and
      People as the drivers of sales. I read an article by Jakob Lusensky,
      stating that business is now about the 4 E's: Emotion, Experience,
      Exclusivity and Engagement. I believe that raises the bar for luxury brands
      substantially.





      **ORIT**: YOU'VE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS A LONG TIME, YOU'VE SEEN LUXURY
      BRANDS COME AND GO. WHO WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE AS BEST IN CLASS?





      Carol: In my world, in the entire industry, there's always been clear
      competition between the European and American brands. On the European side,
      there's been no doubt that brands like Brunello Cucinelli, Valentino and
      Etro have made their mark by building on their history and by keeping their
      product quality equal to the expectation of the clientele. On the American
      side, Ralph Lauren's line is iconic—I don't know of another brand that
      speaks to the luxury client more successfully. Everyone wants to emulate
      the lifestyle that he portrays. Michael Kors, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein
      have shared the spotlight as well. More recently, I think the girls from
      The Row are bringing the next generation of luxury to the forefront.





      **ORIT**: WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE SUCCESS OF A LUXURY
      BRAND?





      Carol: Ensuring the continued quality of the brand experience.​

      The connection is intellectual and emotional, but it always goes back to
      how the product stands the test of time.





      **ORIT**: SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT RECENTLY IS HOW BRANDS ARE
      FACING THE CHALLENGE OF SPEAKING TO MILLENNIALS, AN ASPIRATIONAL AUDIENCE
      WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW.





      Carol: I think that question has to be segmented. There is definitely
      a group of Millennials that have grown up around luxury. That group's point
      of view is not very different from the previous generation, but they've
      also experienced the rise of Fast Fashion and will buy into that area as
      well. Additionally, there is a group that aspires to experience upscale
      product. The luxury brands that have created diffusion lines are opening up
      the world to young people who are successful in their own right, even if
      they didn't come from a background that knows luxury. To them it's
      a reward, whether it's a watch, a handbag or a great experience; in a way
      it elevates their self-worth.





      **ORIT**: WHAT BRANDS OUT THERE DO YOU THINK ARE ABLE TO BRIDGE THAT GAP?





      Carol: I would bet that most of that generation's first purchase above and
      beyond their comfort level occurred in the area of premium denim brands.
      They're spending two or three hundred dollars on J Brand or Current Elliot.
      From there maybe it proceeds to upscale contemporary: Elizabeth and James,
      Alexander Wang, Vince, etc. After they might buy an expensive Michael Kors
      handbag, or if they really want to celebrate maybe it's a Bottega Veneta.
      It's gradual, they step up piece-by-piece, until they have enough in their
      wardrobe that they have grown accustomed to high quality, and that moves
      them in the luxury direction.





      **ORIT**: SO WHAT'S ON THE HORIZON FOR BRANDS IN THE LUXURY CATEGORY, HERE
      OR ABROAD?





      Carol: The job branding people do to create meaningful messages comes so
      well scripted as a result of the technology that's now available. It's then
      up to retailers to deliver that quality and messaging, to connect with the
      consumer's lifestyle needs. That process is well married today. It's
      step-by-step leading toward greater awareness for brands, and that
      awareness is huge with this new generation of consumers who spend so much
      time in the digital world. That said, there's so much misdirected e-mail
      from brands. There's a huge opportunity for companies who have all the
      pieces in place to take advantage of technology and really analyze their
      client's e-commerce habits, and use that information to stay focused on the
      message and the targeted consumer.





      **ORIT**: DO YOU THINK CONSUMERS HAVE BECOME MORE FICKLE?





      Carol: There was a time when consumers had three or four favorite brands
      and were perfectly satisfied with how those fit into their lifestyle.​

      I've seen stores like Saks, Bergdorf's and Neiman's decide that customer
      service is part of the reason you're able to keep the customer engaged;
      making sure the sale is not the end of the relationship but rather the
      beginning. Recognizing the lifestyle and connecting the product is key to
      success. Mitchells of Westport, CT has developed a science in customer
      service. They keep track of their client's lifestyle and know who's
      traveling overseas and whether that client needs new handkerchiefs, for
      example. Then they manage to deliver to the hotel in Paris. These things
      resonate with the client. It's about completely immersing yourself in the
      customer's profile.





      **ORIT**: WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT LATELY ABOUT STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS,
      AND IT COMES DOWN TO A RIGHT OR WRONG DECISION THAT COULD HELP OR HURT
      A BRAND. WHO DO YOU THINK HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH PARTNERSHIPS?





      Carol: The push for partnerships is so widespread, it's coming from the car
      industry, it's coming from the watch industry. Shinola, for example, has
      brought their factory and expertise into the Detroit neighborhood purposely
      to bring jobs to the community. They saw a need and addressed it. Retailers
      and consumers will buy into that brand just because it's aware of society's
      needs.





      **ORIT**: TALK TO US ABOUT EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE FROM A BRAND – WHAT DOES
      THAT MEAN TO YOU? HOW DO BRANDS REALLY ENSURE CONSISTENT SERVICE?





      Carol: The brands that are most successful in the retail community have
      a training element that is essential. Think about Starbucks—you go there
      and all you're thinking about is getting your coffee, but what did it take
      to build the infrastructure so that consistent cup of coffee arrives
      through a channel that leaves very little room for failure? This is
      a company who has clarified the product and the service thoroughly.





      **ORIT**: LASTLY, WHAT ARE YOUR PERSONAL LUXURIES?





      Carol: I happen to be a person who, after all these years of being
      surrounded by luxury, seeks out experiences. My very favorite luxury is
      being able to take the time to add a little texture to my life—taking two
      weeks during the summer and going to a vacation spot that allows me to
      expand my mind is the luxury I wait for all year long.





      **ORIT**: WERE YOU ABLE TO DO THAT THIS YEAR?





      Carol: I was! I went to an arts colony in western New York called
      Chautauqua, which was founded in 1874. My husband's family has had a home
      there since 1929 and we go every summer; it makes you better at who you are
      and what you do.
