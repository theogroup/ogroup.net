      Last year ros&eacute; was on everyone’s minds and this year seems no
      different. Aside from counting down the days until I can sip a glass of
      Whispering Angel on the beaches of Montauk, I’ve also developed an interest
      in exactly how ros&eacute; became the queen bee of the wine industry. So
      let’s reminisce.

















      **1980:**&nbsp;Your Mom is out for drinks with her girlfriends and they
      order glasses of "white zinfandel." The name for that dark pink wine
      varietal is never spoken again by any millennial.

















      **1985:&nbsp;**A 21 year old enters a bar for the first time, panics and
      orders a white zinfandel thinking, "If Mom drinks it, it must be okay…" The
      sweetness acts as a gateway into a broader spectrum of wines for newly
      legal drinkers across the US.

















      **1990:&nbsp;**Beverage industry movers and shakers pick up on the rise of
      ros&eacute; happening across the pond. History proves that most European
      beverage trends hit NYC markets about 3 years later.

















      **1992:**&nbsp;The first ros&eacute; wine is produced in Long Island by
      Wolffer Estate.

















      **1993–2013:**&nbsp;Many summer parties, charity events, etc. are thrown in
      major US beach towns and cities where the wine is flowing and people start
      falling in love with ros&eacute;.

















      **2014:&nbsp;**The New York Post releases an article announcing that the
      Hamptons are running "dangerously low" on ros&eacute;—chaos ensues!

















      **Today:**&nbsp;Now we are #blessed with many Instagram accounts such as
      #ros&eacute;allday, the infamous White Girl Ros&eacute; brand from The Fat
      Jewish and countless events where we can all get together and celebrate the
      peak of our love of ros&eacute;.

















      **Enter:**&nbsp;[Pierrick
      Bouquet](https://www.instagram.com/pierrickbouquet/). You know when you
      have that moment of "why didn’t I think of that?" This guy symbolizes
      everything about that statement. What do millennials love more than
      drinking ros&eacute;? The answer is drinking ros&eacute; in the presence of
      yachts, picnics and music festivals. Pierrick launched America’s first
      ros&eacute; wine festival, La Nuit en Ros&eacute; in 2014. The event
      invites attendees to set sail around NYC aboard a 200-foot yacht while
      enjoying wine, food, beauty services, entertainment and fashion. Tickets
      are available now, June 9–11. Our client, Chandon (MHUSA), will be hosting
      a lounge onboard, which is one of the many reasons we love them.

















      This year, Pierrick took the success of La Nuit en Ros&eacute; and ran with
      it—straight to the music festival loving millennials with the launch of
      Pinknic. From July 9–10 you can picnic on Governor’s Island, which will be
      bathed in four thousand pink-hued designer blankets. Dress code is pink and
      white, gourmet picnic baskets can be pre-ordered from celebrity chef Chris
      Santos and DJ sets and performances will be happening all weekend.

















      So on the eve of the unofficial holiday weekend of ros&eacute;, let’s raise
      our glasses. To the death of white zinfandel, and the continued rise of
      #ros&eacute;allday.​
