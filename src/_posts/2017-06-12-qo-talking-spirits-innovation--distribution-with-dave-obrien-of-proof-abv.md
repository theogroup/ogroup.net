      I think his own words are better than any I'll come up with by way of
      introduction, so I'll let the man speak for himself: "I can take any
      spirits brand from pure idea on a cocktail napkin to already created in the
      market and help make it better." Great elevator pitch, right?





      Sneak peak of our chat below; I hope you enjoy the conversation and window
      into the alcoholic beverage industry!​

      **ORIT**: YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS INDUSTRY A LONG TIME; WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN AS
      A MAJOR SHIFT?





      Dave O'Brien: People ask that question a lot! The answer everyone expects
      is that "the rise of craft spirits has been a big deal." I think more
      practically. I think the biggest changes I've seen have come on the
      distributors' side. Consolidation in distribution has been the biggest
      bottleneck in our industry, and the biggest barrier to getting product to
      market.





      You can come up with a great idea and great product, but unless you have
      really great distribution, it will never reach the consumer. As
      distributors have consolidated over the years it's harder and harder to get
      their attention and get your product to market. That's the single biggest
      challenge. If you want to go ahead and create a luxury lifestyle brand, it
      gets even harder.





      **ORIT**: ONE SURPRISING PERSONAL LUXURY?





      Dave: I could talk about how I really love Scotch, or a great watch or
      eyeglasses that my dog chews.​

      When I go to these places I'll scour the internet, read every review, and
      find the best most authentic thing I can get there. Funny enough, it's
      usually the cheapest thing!





      I'll carve out whatever time it takes to go and find it. I'm very fortunate
      to be able to travel like I do, but the best thing was to get in my car,
      drive four hours down this winding road, and find this one guy, "GJ's Huli
      Chicken." It was the most amazing tasting thing you've ever had in your
      entire life. You can have these four star meals, you can fly private jets,
      but oh that chicken!





      That's luxury: appreciating something for its simplicity and perfection.​
