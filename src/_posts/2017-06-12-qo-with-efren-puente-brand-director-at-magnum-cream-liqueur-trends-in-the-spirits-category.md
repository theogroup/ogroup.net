      Full disclosure: The O Group has recently worked with Efren on&nbsp;[Magnum
      Cream Liqueur](http://ogroup.net/work/Magnum_Creative_Campaign.html). When
      Magnum was looking to enter the US market, both Efren and The O Group felt
      the same way about the brand: this one had potential. We speak to a lot of
      spirits brands, but here was a contender ready to shake up a sleepy
      category. Needless to say we're excited to continue to propel the brand
      forward together.





      Efren has been in this business a long time—working with companies and
      brands like Shieffelin and Somerset, Diageo, Russian Standard and The
      Charmer Sunbelt Group—you could say he knows a thing or two about this
      industry. Enjoy the conversation!





      **ORIT**: WHAT HAS BEEN THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN SPIRITS?





      Efren Puente: Without question, the pace and volume of innovation. For some
      time only a handful of spirits companies focused on innovation and did it
      well. I think now the consumer is ready for it, and even demanding it. The
      shift has allowed a lot of smaller, craft players to enter the game, and in
      turn continued to spur on creativity in the larger companies. Flavors are
      a major part of that trend. You're seeing flavor innovation in the bourbon
      category now, which had never been done before: Jack Daniels Honey, for
      example. Clearly the consumer had a pent up need for that brand. It's the
      younger generation who's more "promiscuous" if you will—willing to venture
      outside of the known and try new things, and category flavor innovation
      plays into that.





      **ORIT**: WHAT'S THE FUTURE OF E-COMMERCE AND SPIRITS?





      Efren Puente: Of course there's a significant amount of attention on the
      digital space given the eyeballs you can reach, and the growth across
      categories. That said, there are clearly many legal barriers to e-commerce
      in the spirits category—and so at least for the near future I don't think
      that's where major focus will be.​

      **ORIT**: WHAT TYPES OF SUCCESS STILL SURPRISE YOU?





      Efren Puente: Honestly, it's the way brands find accounts, and vice versa.
      Serious time and energy on the part of marketing and brand teams goes into
      pinpointing an ideal occasion, account and consumer, but so often I'm still
      surprised by the type of account a given brand gains traction in. I've also
      seen situations where owners of bars or off-premise accounts really rally
      behind a certain brand, and drive success in an account that you just
      weren't expecting.





      **ORIT**: WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD OF MIXOLOGY? IT WAS SUCH A BUZZY
      TREND, HAS IT COME AND GONE?





      Efren Puente: I think living in New York one has a skewed view of the
      world. While it might be a bit "overdone" here or in Brooklyn, in other
      parts of the country it's just beginning to catch on and really fueling new
      accounts. At the end of the day you'd always rather be part of an industry
      that's excited about trying new things and finding a way to build better
      cocktails. For purveyors of luxury goods that is good news: it means more
      opportunities for those premium brands.





      **ORIT**: IS THERE A BRAND YOU'D CONSIDER ON TOP OF WHAT'S NEXT?





      Efren Puente: One of the more innovative concepts I've seen recently is
      from a small startup called "SX Liquors." The packaging is really creative,
      it tastes great and it's premium priced. They're approaching different
      categories under one brand name, which is unusual but seems to be working.
      I'm interested to see where they end up.​
