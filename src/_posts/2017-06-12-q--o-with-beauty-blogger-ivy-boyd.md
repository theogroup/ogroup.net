      **O:** You started out as a graphic designer, what have you found are the
      parallels between graphic design and makeup artistry?









      **Ivy:** I’ve been an artist my entire life and there are so many
      similarities to makeup. I utilize principles like color theory, symmetry,
      balance and proportion everyday in my work. A face is just a living,
      breathing canvas, and my favorite kind at that!









      <br>**O**: The beauty industry is worth over $200 billion dollars, in this
      competitive market, what sets apart a luxury beauty product from the rest?









      **Ivy:**As consumers become more educated and aware of ingredients, cleaner
      products are going to come out on top I think. If a brand can create
      products that are free of parabens, petrochemicals, animal testing and
      harsh chemicals but still convey an upscale feel, they will succeed
      tremendously. It’s guilt-free luxury.









      <br>**O:** You have very particular and rigorous litmus tests for new
      products, what would you say are the hallmarks of good makeup products?









      **Ivy:** Even though I am a working makeup artist, and can make most things
      work if I have to, most brands are appealing to the consumer. There
      shouldn’t be a steep learning curve. Products should be simple and
      user-friendly, in packaging that can stand up to daily life and accomplish
      the goal in minimal steps. We’re busier than ever; we don’t always have the
      time to sleep 8 hours or apply our makeup perfectly, but we want to look as
      though we do.









      <br>**O:** What in your opinion sets a luxury makeup apart artist from the
      rest?









      **Ivy:** I’ll tell you right now; it doesn’t mean just using luxury brands.
      Getting your makeup done is just as much an experience as it is a result.
      A luxury makeup artist makes you feel special and taken care of. You become
      more than a makeup artist, but a helper and a friend. You do things beyond
      the call of duty, reducing a bride’s stress in any way you can.









      <br>**O:** What sort of effect has social media had on the makeup
      industry?









      **Ivy:** Both negative and positive effects can be seen. While I’m glad
      that more people are becoming interested and aware of the power of makeup,
      I also see what I call the "sea of same.” I am now bored with cut creases,
      over-drawn lips, super fake looking lashes, heavily defined brows carved
      out with concealer. It’s not new or fresh anymore. We don’t all need to
      look alike; that’s weird.









      **O:** What in your opinion are the most important beauty items that one
      should have regardless of current trends?









      **Ivy:** Trends are for fun and they are temporary, but try one at a time!
      Otherwise, it looks a bit crazy. Armed with a foundation that matches your
      skin tone and makes your skin look healthy and true-to-life, you can do
      anything. I also think you need a great mascara and blush no matter what.
      Having color in the skin is a good thing and lashes frame your eyes, no
      matter how long or short.









      **O:** What does Rethink Luxury mean to you?









      **Ivy:** To me, luxury doesn’t equate gold, script fonts, heavily
      fragranced, out of reach products. Without naming names, there are many
      luxury makeup brands full of cheap fillers, fragrances and unfortunate
      ingredients, at high price points. To rethink luxury means prioritizing the
      ingredients in the products you are investing your money in and putting on
      your skin. You deserve the best; so don’t settle for crap in fancy
      packages. I want a luxury product to check all the boxes: effective, safe,
      enjoyable to use.​
