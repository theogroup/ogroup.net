      It’s one of the fastest growing trends for 2017, although we wouldn’t refer
      to it as such. Infotainment is always relevant. These videos incorporate
      all of the reasons why content marketing is so successful today. And to put
      it simply, infotainment is the merging of entertainment and information.
      It’s difficult to imagine this could go out of favor anytime soon.









      The most successful, flourishing luxury brands have learned to evolve
      faster than ever before. And in 2017, it may no longer be enough to inform
      or entertain audiences. Combining both worlds will elevate your brand to
      a whole new level while aiding audiences in cutting through the noise.
      Their reward? Discovering content that’s truly worthwhile and worthy of
      being passed along.









      Infotainment video for luxury can offer content that’s entertaining yet
      useful. Consider the joys of learning about a favorite wine. Many
      enthusiasts don’t find sourcing and consuming fine wine to suffice. The joy
      extends to learning more about the varietal, the region and even the year
      of production. Use this as your source of inspiration. Luxury consumers
      want to learn fun facts they haven’t been exposed to before for tidbits to
      share in social situations.









      Champagne Bollinger is a wonderful example. They excel at infotainment with
      videos explaining winemaking methods and traditions while sharing their
      company culture, all to cinematic effect. The videos emphasize exacting
      measures behind-the-scenes such as the daily hand rotation of bottles.
      Bollinger’s riddler rotates approximately 50,000 bottles each day by just
      an eighth or quarter of a turn to fuse the sediments. It’s infotainment
      that informs, entertains and serves to highlight the excellence of the
      brand.









      Most brands will fare best by avoiding going too deep into subject matter
      or featuring esoteric themes. Luxury audiences are diverse and the aim is
      to capture and sustain the attention of most of your target market for
      a successful campaign. Strive for exclusivity. What content encompasses
      your expertise but isn’t considered to be common knowledge? What type of
      content will keep viewers coming back for more? These are the videos your
      clients want to see, they can’t wait to share and that which will inspire
      the possibility of a purchase.









      The Chanel fashion house has seen success with infotainment video for
      years. Much of their world of haute couture is shrouded in secrecy - from
      the design processes to the names of clientele. However, Chanel offers
      quick, exclusive peeks into the master craft process each season for social
      media. The brief clips entertain and appeal to the emotions with attractive
      music and visuals while giving an idea of just how much work it takes to
      create a single couture look. It works because it’s just as intriguing for
      the passive viewer as it is for devoted clientele.









      Whether it’s the history and origins of wine and spirits or the
      handcrafting process of luxe goods, intriguing and valuable content “wins”
      every time.​
