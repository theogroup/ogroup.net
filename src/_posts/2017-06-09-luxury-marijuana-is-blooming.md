      As more states legalize the plant’s recreational use, entrepreneurs,
      investors and brands have begun to capitalize on this burgeoning industry.
      “From a branding perspective, the legal cannabis landscape is maturing
      incredibly fast,” says Denver-based Strategy Director Jacob Lake.
      “Traditional CPG marketers and designers are migrating to work on this
      burgeoning category and they’re bringing that elevated skillset to an
      industry that was previously pretty fly-by-night in terms of design and
      brand fundamentals.” Does this growing opportunity make sense for luxury
      brands? Yes, but not for every brand. The stigma associated with marijuana
      use certainly prevents many established, traditional luxury brands from
      throwing their hat into the ring. However, for less traditional luxury
      brands the opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to push the
      envelope could reap big benefits. An alternative to jumping into a
      contentious category with an established brand might be to create an
      offshoot brand. Offshoot brands can allow an established brand to safely
      capitalize on the growth of the industry by leveraging their branding
      expertise, while avoiding potential backlash from less progressive
      consumers. Some new entities have already begun paving the way for more
      luxury marijuana-focused brands to enter the space, and nearly every
      aspect of marijuana culture is experiencing some element of high-end
      branding. Combating stereotypes with design sensibilities borrowed from
      fashion retail, Silverpeak Apothecary in Aspen, Colorado, is demonstrating
      that the need for premium marijuana retail spaces is very real. Rich wood
      lines the walls and cases of the store, and its products are displayed in
      a way similar to how you would find handbags and accessories shown in a
      Soho shop. When it comes to edibles, a few brands have taken an upscale
      approach to their products. D&eacute;fonc&eacute; Choclatier, for
      instance, comes across as a high-end, luxury chocolate artisan. From its
      elegant packaging, to the flowery language the brand uses to describe its
      process and products, one might mistake the brand for being just another
      premium chocolate producer. Inside their gorgeous exterior, however,
      D&eacute;fonc&eacute;’s creations pack a marijuana boost. For those who
      prefer smoking, Aura is a brand that believes that smoking should look as
      elevated as the smoker feels. Their flagship product is designed first and
      foremost to deliver a quality smoking experience – an experience that just
      so happens to be delivered in a sleek, modern and fantastic looking
      vessel. And the list goes on.

      The key to success appears to be the utilization of cues that connote
      premium, but that don’t scream “reefer madness.

      From marijuana-inspired designs gracing the runways of world-famous
      fashion designers, to vaporizing devices that appear to have been designed
      by Silicon Valley’s best and brightest, affluent marijuana consumers have
      more options at their disposal than ever before. “The cannabis industry is
      leading a soaring growth trajectory over the next 10 years and I think it
      will find itself in a similar situation as the beer business has
      recently,” says Lake. “Ultimately, I think the luxury echelon of cannabis
      has a huge upside, as consumers seek new and exclusive products in this
      emerging market. We’re already seeing limited edition production runs,
      packaging and brand collaborations and even specific genetics or strains
      that are coveted for their rarity, potency or pedigree. As legalization
      continues, I think the high end opportunities are bountiful.”

      If the marijuana industry is going to continue to grow, it has a
      responsibility to demonstrate that these premium products help responsible
      consumers indulge responsibly, without sacrificing design aesthetics.​
