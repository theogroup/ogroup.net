      developing differentiated and compelling branded concepts.





      **ORIT**: WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES LUXURY HOSPITALITY BRANDS ARE
      CURRENTLY FACING?





      Arlene Spiegel: I think, just to set the groundwork here, we need to define
      "luxury" – that's probably the big enigma here, because the word "luxury"
      has changed.





      One of the companies that changed the meaning of luxury is a little brand
      called Starbucks. People now spend $5 on what used to be a commodity item.
      Starbucks priced and positioned itself in such a way that, regardless of
      the economy, the masses felt that they could afford this luxury. In that
      line of thinking, luxury can be as simple as a cup of coffee, or it can be
      a $10K spa retreat.





      **ORIT**: SO HOW CAN BRANDS NAVIGATE WHAT "LUXURY" MEANS?





      Arlene: Defining what luxury means in a diverse population is really
      a challenge for brand managers. If you look at the hotel sector, from
      a Four Seasons all the way down to a Holiday Inn Express, the expectations
      are different, especially of "value". When someone pays for something and
      they're loosely thinking of it as a "luxury", which is common in the
      hospitality world, having a chocolate on your pillow or a shuttle service
      at a Holiday Inn Express can be considered a luxury, and can add to that
      perception.





      **ORIT**: WHAT DO CONSUMERS EXPECT OF LUXURY BRANDS TODAY?





      Arlene: Everyone needs and deserves luxury – which to me means "reward"
      more than anything. I think what makes something luxurious is when you can
      afford an item for the sole purpose of rewarding yourself for the hard
      chore of getting through the day.





      I think the customer expects the "reward" factor to differentiate the
      brand, to call it out as luxury. What makes us feel like this is special?
      You might not be able to afford the filet mignon, but within that category
      you're going to buy the cookie for $6 because you want to reward yourself
      – it makes it accessible to differentiate between the every day, the basic
      needs or commodities that make your life work, and a luxury.





      **ORIT**: THE "VALUE" THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER, WHERE DOES THAT COME INTO
      PLAY IN THE CONSUMER'S HEAD?





      Arlene: Value for luxury brands is really like the L'Oreal commercial,
      "Because you're worth it". Something on that shelf that makes her throw all
      her practicality to the wind and say, you know what, I'll spend more on
      this because I'm worth it!





      **ORIT**: HOW ARE BRANDS ABLE TO MAKE PEOPLE PULL THAT TRIGGER?





      Arlene: A brand needs to narrow their target market, create a targeted
      awareness of the brand, and then attach that awareness to some benefit to
      a particular group's lifestyle drivers.





      I'll give you an example. Hu Kitchen is a complete lifestyle brand for
      people who place a lot of value on eating non-processed, healthy foods in
      a certain way. To get to the point where consumers were ready to "pull the
      trigger", we appealed to the consumers we wanted to reach through channels
      where they already were: yoga studios, gyms, etc. Places where people had
      an active healthy lifestyle. We went to those outlets to build our
      community, and then provided them with content and incentives and events to
      get on their radar. We used strategic messengers by first engaging the
      insiders who had influence. Hu Kitchen is an expensive food store, whether
      you're getting prepared foods or a smoothie, but people have no problem
      paying because for this target consumer, this is their luxury.





      **ORIT**: WHAT DO YOU FEEL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE SUCCESS OF
      A BRAND?





      Arlene: I always think about three things: what do you want to do, why do
      you want to do it, and then if you can justify it, can you figure out how
      to do it? So it's what, why and how, that's it – answer those three
      questions.​

      **ORIT**: WHAT'S ON THE HORIZON FOR BRANDS IN THE HOSPITALITY CATEGORY?





      Arlene: What I see crossing my desk right now are exotic snacks—if you
      follow the different industries that I do, the snack sector is growing
      exponentially. People are trading up with snacks, just like they did in the
      burger category, from mass to gourmet, or the vodka category, from regular
      to premium. They want something exotic and want to feel like they've
      "graduated" in their choice, especially the Millennial and the Boomer
      markets that want that reward. What you're seeing now is a confluence of
      value drivers in this snack industry. Of course that growth includes "halo
      snacks" – you know, gluten free, lower in fat, etc. – snacks that will give
      you the crunch or flavor, but maybe they're made out of lentil.





      **ORIT**: LAST QUESTION, WHAT ARE YOUR PERSONAL LUXURIES?





      Arlene: There's a great book out there, Customer Intimacy, by Fred
      Wiersema. It's about how anyone in the service industry is in the customer
      intimacy business – your company driver is to figure out how to make the
      consumer happy and stick with your brand.





      For me, on a personal level, luxury is about services and intimacy.
      "Intimacy" is another stickiness, one of those things a brand needs to work
      at. It's what successful hotels have done for years. They make you feel
      like an insider, "one of the club." They know how to anticipate and deliver
      your needs. That's what luxury is all about.
