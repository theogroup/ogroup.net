  Developing brand strategy is about more than simply looking at consumer
  spending or predilections — we can paint a much more complete picture of how
  to solve a brand's challenge if we consider people (or clients, or consumers)
  as whole human beings with lives that extend far beyond purchase behavior.​

      As a creative agency, staying on top of cultural trends is critical to
      doing our job well. So let's dive into three trends that we've found
      particularly meaningful lately. Without further ado, the top three
      cultural trends for premium brands to keep in mind as they're considering
      their next moves: 1. FEWER BETTER THINGS Over the past few years, the
      curation trend has bubbled over into personal possessions in an
      interesting way. &nbsp;Don't think you're the only sucker for articles
      titled, "How to pare your wardrobe down to 20 key pieces," and we think
      there's a cultural motivation behind the growing interest in fewer, better
      things. We live in a time where it's possible to have a toothbrush and a
      parka delivered to your door in under two hours. Mindless overconsumption
      isn't just backseat worry for people. It's now a real possibility and
      easily achieved with just a few clicks – especially in major cities which
      already provide unparalleled access to goods. Much in the way we've seen
      premium advertising shift entirely away from push messaging and toward the
      delivery of personalized, valuable content, we are beginning to see the
      rise of premium and luxury businesses built on meeting the needs of people
      who have had quite enough with the endless barrage of "stuff." This is
      interesting, especially when you consider that affluent consumers have the
      greatest buying power — yet the success of brands like Cuyana proves that
      just because you can, doesn't mean you'd prefer to. Cuyana's philosophy is
      perhaps the best way to sum up the content of this cultural trend:​

      Who doesn't want to pursue the promise of a fuller, better life —
      especially if all it entails is paring down what you own? Then again,
      maybe we just live in a crowded bubble (NYC) where it's easier to idealize
      using less space and owning less things since you really have no space to
      store your belongings. Any wide-open-plains folks care to weigh in? 2.
      FAME CULTURE AS A TOOL If you live in the United States, and not under a
      rock, you're familiar with the power of celebrity and fame culture and the
      weight devoted to it in media. Plenty of celebrities shun that spotlight,
      while others use it as a second revenue stream with a constant series of
      collaborations, licenses and products. And then there's a growing segment
      that has chosen to harness the attention for good. We've seen two standout
      examples of this over that past few years that made us think this is more
      than a few celebrities with hearts of gold (Jolie-Pitt Clan) on an
      independent mission. George Clooney in his first North American commercial
      for Nespresso. The spot is a bit tongue in cheek, but perhaps what
      garnered the most attention was his contract. In an effort proposed by
      Clooney, Nespresso will start selling coffee from South Sudan in order to
      help rebuild an industry that nearly disappeared during decades of civil
      war. He could have easily just taken the millions of dollars to sell
      expensive brown water and no one would have blinked an eye. Instead he
      helped to spur a business's investment in the livelihood of a country in
      need of profitable industry. The other one that caught our eye was Kate
      Winslet's "no photoshopping" clause in her contract with L'Oreal /
      Lancome. She cited feeling a responsibility to be a positive influence on
      women, and realistically portray beauty. This started a trend that we
      admire and applaud. Again, while certain industries have taken steps
      toward reducing retouching – and the US is certainly not the worst
      offender in this space – no one would have thought twice about a retouched
      beauty ad. Instead, regardless of what the ads ultimately look like,
      Winslet is using her fame to share a powerful message with women
      everywhere: success is independent of looks, and beauty comes in many
      different forms. 3. SEEKING MORE MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCES Finally, with
      undertones of both the "fewer better things" trend and the "do well and do
      good" theme, as an agency immersed in travel and hospitality we've noticed
      that travelers across the board are seeking more meaningful experiences
      that can't be replicated elsewhere. This trend extends from the pinnacle
      of luxury properties to mass brands looking to differentiate. At the
      luxury level properties have always been about high touch service and
      creating unforgettable moments. But now consumers want all of those
      things, PLUS a unique property that is reflective of its place — not a
      hotel-brand template. On the mass level, look to Courtyard by Marriott for
      an awesome example of this trend at play in their Viking Ship commercial.
      "Some people have to travel for work, some people get to travel for work,"
      says the voiceover while a Viking rower savors a glass of wine. While on a
      tactical level that glass of chardonnay makes the Courtyard difference,
      the brand really seeks to appeal to the traveler who values "the little
      things" that make an experience meaningful and memorable.​

      Owning fewer, higher quality possessions, leaving a positive mark on the
      world, and making meaningful memories. Premium brands will do well to
      contemplate how to infuse their thinking, brand and offerings with these
      trends in order to maintain relevancy.​
