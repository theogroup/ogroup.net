      As a creative agency, staying on top of cultural trends is critical to
      doing our job well. Today I'd like to dive into three trends that I've
      found particularly meaningful lately. Without further ado, the top three
      cultural trends for premium brands to keep in mind as they're considering
      their next moves:

      1. FEWER BETTER THINGS

      Over the past few years, the curation trend has bubbled over into personal
      possessions in an interesting way. I don't think I'm the only sucker for
      articles titled, "How to pare your wardrobe down to 20 key pieces," and
      I think there's a cultural motivation behind the growing interest in fewer,
      better things.

      We live in a time where it's possible to have a toothbrush and a parka
      delivered to your door in under two hours, and Walmart just announced plans
      to begin testing drone-based delivery systems.

      Mindless overconsumption isn't just backseat worry for people. It's now
      a real possibility and easily achieved with just a few clicks – especially
      in major cities which already provide unparalleled access to goods. Much in
      the way we've seen premium advertising shift entirely away from push
      messaging and toward the delivery of personalized, valuable content, we are
      beginning to see the rise of premium and luxury businesses built on meeting
      the needs of people who have had quite enough with the endless barrage of
      "stuff." This is interesting, especially when you consider that affluent
      consumers have the greatest buying power — yet the success of brands like
      Cuyana proves that just because you can, doesn't mean you'd prefer to.
      Cuyana's philosophy is perhaps the best way to sum up the content of this
      cultural trend:​

      Who doesn't want to pursue the promise of a fuller, better life
      — especially if all it entails is paring down what you own? Then again,
      maybe we just live in a crowded bubble (NYC) where it's easier to idealize
      using less space and owning less things since you really have no space to
      store your belongings. Any wide-open-plains folks care to weigh in?

      2. FAME CULTURE AS A TOOL

      If you live in the United States, and not under a rock, you're familiar
      with the power of celebrity and fame culture and the weight devoted to it
      in media. Plenty of celebrities shun that spotlight, while others use it as
      a second revenue stream with a constant series of collaborations, licenses
      and products. And then there's a growing segment that has chosen to harness
      the attention for good. I've seen two standout examples of this recently
      that made me think this is more than a few celebrities with hearts of gold
      (Jolie-Pitt Clan) on an independent mission.

      George Clooney recently appeared in his first North American commercial for
      Nespresso. The spot was a bit tongue in cheek, but perhaps what garnered
      the most attention was his contract. In an effort proposed by Clooney,
      Nespresso will start selling coffee from South Sudan in order to help
      rebuild an industry that nearly disappeared during decades of civil war. He
      could have easily just taken the millions of dollars to sell expensive
      brown water and no one would have blinked an eye. Instead he helped to spur
      a business's investment in the livelihood of a country in need of
      profitable industry.

      The other one that caught my eye was Kate Winslet's "no photoshopping"
      clause in her contract with L'Oreal / Lancome. She cited feeling
      a responsibility to be a positive influence on women, and realistically
      portray beauty. Again, while certain industries have taken steps toward
      reducing retouching – and the US is certainly not the worst offender in
      this space – no one would have thought twice about a retouched beauty ad.
      Instead, regardless of what the ads ultimately look like, Winslet is using
      her fame to share a powerful message with women everywhere: success is
      independent of looks, and beauty comes in many different forms.

      3. SEEKING MORE MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCES

      Finally, with undertones of both the "fewer better things" trend and the
      "do well and do good" theme, as an agency immersed in travel and
      hospitality we've noticed that travelers across the board are seeking more
      meaningful experiences that can't be replicated elsewhere. This trend
      extends from the pinnacle of luxury properties to mass brands looking to
      differentiate. At the luxury level properties have always been about high
      touch service and creating unforgettable moments. But now consumers want
      all of those things, PLUS a unique property that is reflective of its place
      — not a hotel-brand template.

      On the mass level, look to Courtyard by Marriott for an awesome example of
      this trend at play in their Viking Ship commercial. "Some people have to
      travel for work, some people get to travel for work," says the voiceover
      while a Viking rower savors a glass of wine. While on a tactical level that
      glass of chardonnay makes the Courtyard difference, the brand really seeks
      to appeal to the traveler who values "the little things" that make an
      experience meaningful and memorable.​

      THE TAKEAWAY

      The sum total of these trends points to a growing desire to spend time well, right?​

      Owning fewer, higher quality possessions, leaving a positive mark on the
      world, and making meaningful memories.

      Premium brands will do well to contemplate how to infuse their thinking,
      brand and offerings with these trends in order to maintain relevancy.​
