      1. MILLENNIALS ARE THE MOST DEMANDING LUXURY CONSUMER YET.





      In a surprise to no one, Millennials may be the most demanding luxury
      consumer, but it's probably not in the way you think. While the older
      consumer of a luxury travel experience appreciates and expects to be waited
      on by a personal concierge, always present and available, Millennials
      prefer their wants to be tended to seamlessly—ideally remotely and before
      the need even arises.





      Hilton conducted some interesting testing on the success of a personal
      concierge app, and the response from Millennials was overwhelming. The
      ability to ask for your bags to be unpacked in a certain way, to have
      specific groceries waiting, schedule events and wake up calls, pre-order
      room service (the possibilities are extensive) resonated with the consumer
      who's first thought it to order an Uber, schedule Glamsquad and open
      Flavour for curated local restaurant recommendations. The millennial
      consumer's OS is fundamentally different than the baby boomer, for example.
      It's critical that luxury brands build their service programs to meet the
      consumer at the right time and place, answering their need-state with
      relevant offerings. In support of that thought, Walter Coyle of Pedone
      Media commented, "As the world had become more global people want more to
      embrace those unique luxury experiences." It's the way a brand delivers
      those experiences that has to be reconsidered.





      2. THE LUXURY CONSUMER WILL ALWAYS PAY FOR AN EXPERIENCE.





      There was an overwhelming consensus on the matter of true luxury resting on
      what John Vanderslice referred to as "software, not hardware," as in the
      human experience provided (service) and received, not hard goods. Adam
      Tihany echoed that sentiment, "The most important ingredient in luxury is
      the human touch. Without that, you just have amenities," adding, "Luxury is
      the minute details that add up to someone having designed something to your
      human scale."





      It's no surprise that Laura Davidson, founder of LDPR, expressed the same
      idea in reference to LDPR client Abercrombie & Kent in a recent Q&O
      interview with The O Group.​

      When you place time at a premium, a seamless, unforgettable experience that
      surprises and delights – whether you're purchasing a handbag or traveling
      the Serengeti – is beyond a price tag. The mark of that experience? If at
      the end of the day you hand over your card and think to yourself, "You
      couldn't charge me enough for this," (as Adam Tihany did of a hotel
      experience in Mexico).





      3. FEMALE-FRIENDLY LIFESTYLE BRANDS COULD FILL A WHITE SPACE ACROSS
      LUXURY.





      We've all heard the logic: women will purchase a masculine branded product,
      but men are much less likely to do so. It makes sense, right? Women
      purchase Bailey's, but they're just as likely recently to purchase
      a small-batch whiskey that looks like it was hand labeled in a 19th century
      apothecary. "Mens-wear" is consistently popular women's fashion, but
      "womens-wear" for men? Far less mainstream. With all that in mind, our
      speakers turned to the idea of a luxury lifestyle brand that caters more to
      women than men. In all fairness, Vanderslice of Hilton referenced qualities
      such as "light, bright and airy" and "celebrating the neighborhood" in
      describing a Hilton brand in development—hardly attributes likely to
      alienate a man.





      That said, the idea still stands: with women more likely to purchase luxury
      products as a means of "self-reward and pampering" (Source: KMPG) and
      "Senior women age 50 and older [controlling a] net worth of $19 trillion
      and own more than three-fourths of the nation's financial wealth" (Source:
      Mass Mutual Financial Group) – why not skew more female in branding? How
      much market share are brands who continue to ignore the possibilities of
      a more "female-friendly" offering losing? It's an interesting perspective
      to consider, and one we're excited to think about across categories.​
