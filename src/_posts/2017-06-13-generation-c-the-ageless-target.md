      Rather than being offended, my father replied with an equally
      tongue-in-cheek retort: "Good. Now maybe I'll stop getting bombarded with
      emails from companies that I've never heard of, or even like."





      Our exchange centers around an interesting change that has been occurring
      for the past few years – marketers are indeed focusing their attention on
      this younger generation of consumers. It's not surprising either, as the
      media has consistently foretold of the rise of the largest, most motivated
      generation that has the highest buying power. Capturing Millennials'
      attention is akin to harpooning a marketing white whale.





      But as Millennials begin to softly realize these projections, it's becoming
      apparent that this generation might not be the be-all, end-all target
      audience for marketers. In fact, using "Millennials" as your target
      audience could prove to be a lazy and damaging tactic for future work. You
      simply cannot group Millennials together in a singular sample.





      For starters, Millennials are extremely diverse – and not just in the
      demographic sense. With their increased numbers come an incredibly high
      number of sub-sets and psychographic differentiators within their ranks.
      One look at the stratification of their musical, culinary and fashion
      tastes, and understanding "their" tastes becomes clear as mud.​

      Secondly, the definition of what constitutes a Millennial varies greatly
      from person-to-person and brand-to-brand. For some, this group includes
      those born between 1980 and 2004. For others, a more nebulous descriptor of
      "born after 1982, and came of age around the year 2000" is used. In each
      instance, you're talking about a group whose ages range from their early
      teens to 30-somethings. That's a massive leap in ages, in cultural tastes,
      and in life milestones.





      These discrepancies are what make a concept like the Connected Generation,
      or Generation C, a more viable option for audience targeting. Rather than
      being defined by their age, this "generation" is grouped together by their
      habits and predilections. And while Google boasts that over 65% of this
      cohort is under the age of 35, you can find members of every generation
      (including Boomers) within C's ranks.​

      Obviously, the "C" in their moniker comes from their habit of being
      connected at all times. They consume media, interact with the world, and
      share content through a variety of platforms and devices to the point where
      it is second nature. They are highly-engaged, and are truly a force to be
      reckoned with. The onus falls on marketers to keep their attention.





      Now, Gen C isn't a new concept. In fact, there are already a stable of
      brands and companies that are successfully reaching out to this group and
      reaping the benefits of targeting a mindset rather than a demographic. The
      key is to avoid alienating potential consumers through the use misguided
      creative work that is pandering to a specific age group.​
