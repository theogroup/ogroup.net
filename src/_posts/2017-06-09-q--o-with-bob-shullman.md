      **There is a stark contrast in how Baby Boomers, Gen-X and Millennials view
      luxury and which luxury brands they covet. What in your opinion have been
      the most influential factors in this difference?**

































































      Bob:

































































      Well to me there are a few elements that have really impacted how the
      different generations are looking at the topic of luxury. One is clearly
      unlimited access to information through the web. The other issue is when
      these generations first started to experience the web. Some folks grew up
      on paper and pencil. Gen-Xers got computers when they were in their early
      teens, and then the Millennials were basically born into the era of the
      web. I believe when you started experiencing digital, and how comfortable
      you are with the digital way of life, impacts how you think about luxury.

































































      The other thing that has had an influence is the 2008 economic plunge.
      Millennials are starting with rocks around their necks and that is going to
      determine how they see luxury and how they purchase it. The economic
      circumstances faced by Millennials will be something that affects the
      luxury industry for a very long time.

      **Post Demographic Luxury is a new buzzword making the rounds. What does
      this term mean to you?**

































































      Bob:

































































      With the digital world you can now tag people behaviorally, and we are now
      past the point of using traditional luxury demographic tools because those
      details no longer give a good indication of how the luxury consumer
      behaves. In the world of advertising research, when we chat about what the
      marketing databases are going to look like in a year from now, what they
      are going to contain and what the ability of marketers to reach certain
      people in certain ways is beyond most people’s comprehension. Demographics
      worked when that was the only way you could deal with it. Demographics are
      very yesterday, especially in the luxury category going forward because of
      how the luxury category retains loyalty needs to change.

































































      **Orit:**

































































      **Vast improvements in technology have lead to an increase in on-demand
      services. Is On-Demand part of new luxury and is instant gratification what
      makes a service luxurious going forward?**

































































      Bob:

































































      From the work I’ve done I can see that on-demand is only one aspect of new
      luxury; there are so many other aspects of it. However, the web has
      definitely changed where and how quickly one can get their goods or
      services, and this does have a significant influence on how a brand is
      perceived. What will be crucial to luxury brands standing out with
      ‘on-demand’ is exactly how luxurious and curated they can make that
      on-demand experience.

































































      **Orit:**

































































      **Let’s discuss the prevalence of another buzzword: The “Global Citizen’.
      What drives the global citizen? And what has changed that allowed the
      global citizen to exist?**

































































      Bob:

































































      Well to me, from an American-centric point of view, the global citizen
      realizes that there is a world far beyond them with other cultures, other
      concerns, wishes and needs. The digital world and communication of news,
      which is now on-demand, has to lead to a hyper-awareness of the world they
      inhabit. They seem to be driven by trends, and social media in particular
      has really connected them to other parts of the world and allowed them to
      genuinely engage with other parts of the world. Another strong factor for
      the emergence of the global citizen is how inexpensive travel has become.
      In other words, the web has allowed for the young luxury consumer to
      participate and voyeur and to then be onsite through curated experience
      that you can coordinate digitally. The Global citizen to me is a luxury
      consumer who knows that luxury exists beyond the traditional realm and
      leans more toward exploring the world for luxury brands because there no
      borders and boundaries online.

      **What does Rethink Luxury mean to you?**

































































      Bob:

































































      You can’t predict the future but you can certainly anticipate it, and to me
      Rethink Luxury means using what you know now about luxury and other
      external factors to anticipate the evolution of luxury marketing.​
