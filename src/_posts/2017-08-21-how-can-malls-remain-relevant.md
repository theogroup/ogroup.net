  Shouldn’t the mall experience evolve to capitalize on how consumers’
  predilections have changed?

      Malls have long existed as a centralized hub of consumerism and cultural
      connectivity, strategically designed and built in locations to receive the
      most traffic. In 1989, when malls experienced a rapid growth across
      America, [photographer Michael Galinsky beautifully captured the cultural
      phenomenon of the shopping mall as central to social life across the
      country](http://rumur.com/malls-across-america/). While his photos now
      transport viewers to a bygone era of big hair and acid washed jeans, they
      also represent a look at a cultural touchstone that was the start of a 30
      year erosion. The descent of the mall has been driven by a number of
      factors: the proliferation of e-commerce, consumers’ desire for more
      unique or locally-made business and brand options, and the rise of
      development orchestrated “town-centers” to name just a few. Despite this
      shift, the potential for shopping malls (and the businesses within their
      walls) to regain consumers’ attention remains real –

      Malls and their tenants need to truly understand the value that consumers
      now place on experience.

      In the journal of Psychological Science, Gilovich, Killingsworth and
      Cornell doctoral candidate Amit Kumar, expanded on the current
      understanding that spending money on experiences, “provide(s) more
      enduring happiness.” ([Nicely summed up by The
      Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/buy-experiences/381132/))
      They looked specifically at anticipation as a driver of that happiness;
      whether the benefit of spending money on an experience accrues before the
      purchase has been made, in addition to after. And, yes, it does. Shouldn’t
      the mall experience evolve to capitalize on how consumers’ predilections
      have evolved? Consider the positive effect that will come from creating a
      lasting experience within the mall environment. A viable avenue toward
      delivering a lasting experience involves the infusion of consumer-friendly
      technology. According to [Bain Consulting’s Leading a Digical
      Transformation](http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/leading-a-digical-transformation.aspx),
      “Straight-line extrapolations of digital dominance miss some important
      insights. We humans are physical and social beings. We like to go out, to
      interact in person with other people, to touch and handle and make things.
      The real transformation taking place today isn’t the replacement of
      physical by digital, it’s the marriage of the two into combinations that
      create wholly new sources of value.” The key for malls is the
      incorporation of technology that responds to shoppers’ wants and needs,
      and at the same time serves as inspiration for consumers to modify how
      they approach the physical shopping experience.

      Malls should consider using technology to create a fluid and personalized
      journey that delivers unexpected engagement along the way.

      Speaking of mobile technology, “showrooming” has become a common part of
      our lexicon. It’s nearly impossible to prevent savvy shoppers from
      attempting to find the best price for the products they desire. That said,
      malls have an opportunity to take advantage of the showrooming trend by
      demonstrating the added value of brick and mortar experience as a
      complement to mobile consumerism. Will we ever return to the shopping
      mall’s heyday? Perhaps not, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
      Fashion, media, and technology have all evolved over time, and the way
      people shop is no different.


      The key for malls is to continually improve the experience for consumers
      by reimagining what the physical space can offer, as well as, using
      technology to provide added value. The result, shopping centers become
      adaptable to ever-changing consumer behavior.


      And, like luxury, [mall
      brands](https://www.ogroup.net/blog/4-ways-malls-should-act-like-luxury-brands/)
      need to exceed expectations, surprise and delight, impress and engage.

      It is time to disrupt the world of malls and mall branding, just as the
      rest of retail has been turned sideways.

      By emulating or learning from luxury brands, smart brands will become
      significantly more meaningful and important to people. In doing so, they
      have the potential to enmesh themselves in modern culture in ways
      previously unimaginable.
