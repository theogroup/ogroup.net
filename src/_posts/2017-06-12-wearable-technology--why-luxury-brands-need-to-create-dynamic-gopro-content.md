intro_markdown: "In an earlier article I wrote,&nbsp;[Luxury is the New Black](http://ogroup.net/luxury_branding_blog/the-new-black/), I talked about brands using the word \"black\" to denote a high-end offering. So I wasn't completely surprised to see that GoPro, the amazing video camera brand, had released a new model, \"GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition.\"​"

(In fact, while writing this article, GoPro announced its IPO.) It's everywhere. And it's more than a camera company. It's a content platform unto itself.​"

      It really got me thinking: Luxury brands were late to the game with regard
      to website functionality, e-commerce and social media. They'd better not
      miss the opportunity to take advantage of the convergence of Wearable
      Technology and Dynamic Content. Luxury brands really need to own this one.





      GoPro became popular so quickly because it lets people use Social Media
      (specifically Facebook, YouTube and Vimeo) to share high-quality video
      content more easily than ever before. GoPro videos represent the
      democratization of video creation- just look at the name of the brand.
      GoPro turns amateurs into professionals. And with #selfies, #yolo and #fomo
      so popular, who wouldn't want to capture amazing video of themselves
      surfing, snowboarding, mountain biking or breathing fire?





      How does this relate to Luxury Branding? Luxury Brands could leverage
      GoPro's high-quality video and wearability to better tell stories and
      connect with consumers. For example, just blocks away from my desk, New
      York Fashion Week 2014 is happening right now. Fashion devotees would love
      to see GoPro on the Runway or better yet, behind-the-scenes. A Luxury brand
      could feature videos of the craftsmanship and production of their high-end
      goods. What would a day in the life of the lead designer look like? Foodies
      could get a POV video of their favorite chef during a busy dinner shift.​

      GoPro was conceived on a surfing trip to Indonesia and began its life as
      a wrist-mounted film camera. It's an authentic product aimed at
      a well-defined audience that it knows quite well, and it has succeeded
      because of the meaningful functional and emotional benefits it delivers to
      that audience. GoPro is about more than people creating and watching great
      video. It's about sharing high-quality, impactful content.





      Luxury brands should seize the opportunity and take advantage of this
      engaging, evolving tool.​
