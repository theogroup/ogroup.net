      Growing up in suburban America, I came of age during a time when an
      Abercrombie & Fitch jean skirt and a pair of Adidas Original sneakers were
      the mark of social competence. Up until recently, I considered both of
      those brands throwback references—to be remembered with equal parts
      nostalgia and cringing. While both have made moves toward a turnaround,
      it’s Adidas that’s blown me away recently by hitting all the right notes of
      a true comeback.

















      **The First Move**

















      It’s not as if Adidas has done anything to hurt their brand over the last
      decade. In fact, they’ve been quietly doing quite well for a while. Their
      retail stores in major markets offer an innovative experience and totally
      updated look and feel, and the Adidas x Stella McCartney collaboration
      (launched in 2004) continues to feel fresh and relevant—and succeed where
      other athletic brands have really missed the mark—combining true style with
      athletic function and material.

















      In 2013 Adidas announced their Season 1 Yeezy clothing and footwear
      collaboration with Kanye West. It seems that this past year the hype around
      the "Adidas Yeezy 350 Boost" finally spilled beyond the sneakerhead
      community, spurred by the fashion world’s intense interest in sneakers, and
      captured major attention. I remember noticing a pair on a man next to me on
      7th avenue in January, and wondering if they sold the same version in
      women’s. When I later realized what I’d been coveting I remember
      thinking—regardless of the collaboration—the product design is totally
      on-trend.

















      More recent brand collaborations pushing Adidas toward relevancy include
      releases with both A$AP Rocky (partnering with designer Jeremy Scott for
      a one-off sneaker, "the JS Wings 2.0 Black Flag," you may have noticed
      them, they literally have wings) and A$AP Ferg (skateboarding
      collection).​

I have no doubt Adidas knew exactly what they were doing when they posted a photo featuring two women on Valentine’s Day with the caption "the love you take is equal to the love you make." While certainly they are not the first big brand to take a stand for equality via advertising, I can’t remember a brand so adamantly and eloquently shutting down trollers and haters alike with responses like, "No, this day is for LOVE. Happy Valentine’s Day."​'

      They got my attention that day, and they launched a total onslaught of
      content across Instagram and Facebook afterward that has solidified
      a newfound interest in the brand.

















      **Slay, Collabs, Slay**

















      Karlie Kloss (Model; Coder; Famed member of T Swift’s Squad). Hannah
      Bronfman (Fitness and Beauty Guru; DJ). Morgan Brian (US Women’s Soccer
      Player; World Cup Winner). The women featured in Adidas’ #heretocreate
      campaign read like a who’s who of inspirational influencers across
      categories, each with a unique take on fitness, creativity AND achievement.
      These ultra short videos are perfectly paced: you’ve watched half of the
      content before you’ve even thought about scrolling by.​

      The right format, on the right platform, with the right collaborators at
      the right time (post-dinner aimless scrolling, am I right?). Without
      shelling out Under Armour level dollars for Giselle, Adidas has pinpointed
      the cultural nexus of multidimensional accomplished women with overlapping
      but not entirely similar, engaged followings.

















      Adidas’ #heretocreate campaign’s ultra-digestible video content is
      inspirational, entertaining and leaves you wanting more—fitting as it’s
      seeming more and more clear that video, specifically on mobile, is the
      future of marketing.

















      This content marketing effort is a great push from the Adidas brand to
      reclaim their territory and category position from brands that have
      overshadowed them lately (read GoPro; Nike; Under Armour). It’s a move
      toward appealing to former brand loyalists like myself who feel a bit of
      nostalgia for Adidas but weren't captivated by the sneakerhead
      collaborations (Kanye, A$AP, etc.) and capturing the attention of new
      audiences.

















      **What does the future look like?**

















      A comeback isn’t about shedding brand DNA, it’s about showcasing the best
      of what was, and promoting what’s to come. In my opinion, Adidas made an
      important step in that direction by bringing back the Stan Smith Original
      in early 2014 (Originally released in 1964; Branding Journal has a really
      great article about the strategy behind that shoe here.)

















      With spring on the horizon the time is right for a sporting goods brand to
      vie for mindshare. I have a feeling I’m not the only one with with a lot of
      heart for Adidas, and I can’t wait to see their next move.​
