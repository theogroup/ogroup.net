      She's been in the spirits industry for twelve years; prior to joining
      Diageo she worked with Schieffelin & Somerset and Moet Hennessy.





      **ORIT**: WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES YOU SEE BRANDS FACING LATELY IN THE
      SPIRITS WORLD?





      Trish Mannion: I think consumers these days are really looking to open
      a dialogue with their favorite brands, particularly in spirits, where there
      is a real emotional connection. This is amplified when it comes to luxury
      and super premium brands. We invite consumers to be a part of the brand
      story and are honored when people make us part of their personal story as
      well.





      **ORIT**: SO HOW DOES THAT APPLY TO THE BRANDS YOU MANAGE AT DIAGEO?





      Trish: For Bulleit and George Dickel we use a lot of social and digital
      marketing because we think it's really critical to creating that personal
      connection. It can be a challenge to keep a constant dialogue going with
      our consumers, just in terms of the sheer volume reaching out, but it is
      incredibly important. In the luxury space, when the brands are very small
      and less apt to be doing major above the line marketing, it really has to
      be about forming deep relationships with your consumer.





      **ORIT**: WERE BRANDS FOCUSING ON DIGITAL BEFORE YOU STARTED WORK WITH
      THEM?





      Trish: I think I've helped build it out a little bit further, but really if
      you look at Bulleit as a brand, that's based on Tom Bulleit spending twenty
      years on the road actually doing hand selling and face-to-face
      introduction. Our part was taking that model and figuring out how we could
      bring it into a broader space and help him amplify his voice. What we can
      do is work with him, share the stories we're hearing via social media with
      him, get his reaction, and then funnel that genuine content back out for
      him.





      **ORIT**: SO HOW CAN BRANDS MAINTAIN THAT SORT OF AUTHENTICITY, THROUGH
      GROWTH AND THROUGH MULTIPLE LEVELS UNTIL THAT MESSAGE REACHES THE
      CONSUMER?





      Trish: We've all been in this business a long time, and on one hand it's
      easier now than it used to be to amplify the message, but on the other
      hand, a lot harder because you have to remain truly authentic. That's
      something I think every brand struggles with. How do you maintain that
      one-on-one dialogue, but on a massive platform? It's not easy, and it's
      something I think we're constantly correcting on our own, but we're very
      fortunate with Bulleit because Tom Bulleit is a living person. We can just
      go back to him and say "Oh, okay, this is how we're going to go forward."





      **ORIT**: SO WHAT BRAND IN YOUR CATEGORY WOULD YOU CONSIDER "BEST IN CLASS"
      IN TERMS OF COHESIVENESS OF THE MESSAGE, THE STORY, AND AMPLIFICATION?





      Trish: The first brand I think of is Bulleit, and it really started with
      Tom Bulleit sharing his story and unintentionally leveraging the social
      power of the bartenders. It's an extremely social environment and they're
      a very connected group. By going out, talking to them, befriending and
      sharing his story with them, they in turn went and amplified his voice.
      It's been easy to amplify, because it's a real story—of Tom being a lawyer,
      but wanting to follow his passion in bourbon making.





      I also really like what Tanqueray is doing right now. They're putting a lot
      of great energy into their "first drink of the night" campaign. I think the
      "Grab the night by the junipers" is really impressive. They've done a great
      job taking a brand that's been around for a very long time, is highly
      awarded and highly respected, and bringing it to consumers in a very
      approachable and relevant way that stays true to the core of the brand.





      **ORIT**: DO YOU THINK THEY FOUND WHITESPACE WITH THAT CAMPAIGN?





      Trish: I think where they are is an interesting space. So many up and
      coming bartenders and influencers are looking for niche and smaller brands,
      and yet Tanqueray is the original London Dry, and one of the most highly
      awarded. Tanqueray #10 has actually been retired from the San Francisco
      Wine and Spirits Competition because they won "Best in Show" three times in
      a row and are no longer allowed to compete.





      So the brand is trying to reconnect to those influencers and say "Okay, so
      we're not five people making it in Brooklyn, but we still make a phenomenal
      product that's worthy of respect and appreciation."​

      **ORIT**: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA AS AN INSIDER HOW THAT'S WORKED FOR THEM?
      HAVE THEY SEEN SALES OR BUZZ INCREASE?





      Trish: I don't know their numbers, but I do know they've seen an increase
      in consumer pull, which is a really healthy parameter. The overall buzz
      factor of the brand is definitely higher than it was a few years ago.





      **ORIT**: WHAT BRAND OUTSIDE OF YOUR CATEGORY DO YOU FEEL REALLY STANDS
      ABOVE THE COMPETITION?





      Trish: I'm often inspired by luxury in general. I think it's my LVMH
      background. Those are the brands I think are always consistent in brand
      message. Fashion houses in general tend to pay deep attention to detail,
      and that makes a tremendous difference for consumers. That can also be the
      challenge when a brand gets very large, maintaining that rigor to ensure
      every piece of communication that goes out is in the brand voice and the
      brand look.





      **ORIT**: WHAT DO YOU SEE AS NEW AND EXCITING IN YOUR CATEGORY NOW, WHAT IS
      GOING TO HAPPEN TO MAKE PEOPLE PAY MORE ATTENTION?





      Trish: American whisky is on fire. It's absolutely one of the hottest
      things happening right now, which lines up with things like the resurgence
      of classic cocktails and everything old being new again. If you look at
      Gatsby and Mad Men, some of these story arcs that have been coming through
      in TV and film, they really link back to original Americana, classic craft
      and classic cocktails, and help drive American Whiskey, and Bourbon in
      particular.





      It's a crowded category, but I think that's actually what makes it a lot of
      fun. There's a ton of innovation, unique flavors and finishes, and whiskies
      at just about every price point.





      At George Dickel one of the things we're opening up now is a "Buy the
      Barrel" program, where you visit our distillery and taste whisky from
      different barrels and choose the one that you want. Then we can bottle it
      and ship it to a retailer locally who you purchase it from. It's kind of
      a neat customization that a lot of other categories of luxury brands have
      been doing for years.





      **ORIT**: WHAT HAS THAT CUSTOMER COME TO EXPECT OF LUXURY BRANDS,
      SPECIFICALLY IN THE SPIRITS CATEGORY?





      Trish: Customization is certainly a big component. There is a shift away
      from price defining quality, but we still expect to get what we pay for.​

      If you're going to spend $90 on a bottle of scotch, you want to understand
      it, you want a little bit of education that you can then share with people
      when they come to your house. Why is it so expensive? If you as the
      consumer can't answer that question, you might be a little flustered. If
      you really understand the product and are passionate about it, you can't
      wait to tell people why it's so good. And that's true in pretty much every
      category.





      **ORIT**: DO YOU THINK IT'S MORE CHALLENGING FOR SOME OF THE CATEGORIES
      WITHIN SPIRITS, FOR EXAMPLE A VODKA CATEGORY, BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO
      SATURATED?





      Trish: If it's a good category, you're going to get a lot of saturation.
      There are brands in vodka that are doing it right and do have great
      consumer stories to tell. Ketel One is a good example. Another is
      C&icirc;roc, who has a reason for existing, a reason for being different,
      and can explain why the flavor of their base vodka (being derived from
      grapes) is unique in the category.





      **ORIT**: WHAT'S THE SECRET TO EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE FROM A BRAND?





      Trish: A personal belief for me is that quick and honest communication will
      get you further, particularly now when our news cycle is 24 hours,
      everything is constant and people expect immediate responses. I find that
      to be true internally for success as well as externally for a brand.





      I think the worst thing you can feel, if you are passionately in love with
      a brand, is if you send them something and never hear back. Responsiveness
      is really critical, as well as honesty. This is a very transparent world
      and it only takes a few keystrokes to find out the truth behind a brand. If
      you don't own your distillery, if you use second-generation wood, whatever
      it is that you do, just share that with consumers and explain why. Usually
      there's a pretty good reason for doing it. But whatever your brand story
      is, you have to share it as honestly as you can.





      **ORIT**: WHAT ARE YOUR PERSONAL LUXURIES?





      Trish: One of my colleagues here thinks it's hilarious that once in
      conversation I said something about my personal trainer and my
      acupuncturist. He told me I was a baller for that. I suppose it turns out
      that those are my personal luxuries!​
