While hotdogs, foam fingers and rowdy fans are still present, many new and, more significantly, upscale additions are becoming standard practice. You're now just as likely to find microbrews and artisanal delicacies, as you are peanuts and crackerjack.​"

      I'm sure the thought of indulging in something other than a foot-long and
      a tall, cold Budweiser during a game might make old school sports fans
      cringe. But elevating dining options and extending to the masses the type
      of service attendees might experience in luxury boxes makes perfect
      business sense. While the need to fill seats has been one of the driving
      forces behind this luxury stadium renaissance, there are other aspects at
      play.





      Competition is strong, and not just from other sporting events.





      We are living in a time with the greatest number of entertainment options
      – options that are constantly competing to demonstrate the best combination
      of value and experience. And it's not just other sporting and entertainment
      events that stadium owners battle. With expansive home theaters becoming
      increasingly popular, the "comforts of home" are increasingly stealing
      fan-share. Factor in record ticket prices and stadiums have needed to step
      up their game. An interesting recent trend has been strategic partnerships
      between stadiums and brands from outside of the sports category. The GQ
      barbershop at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and the Sky Studios
      behind-the-scenes experience at London's O2 Arenaboth offer attendees
      unique and unexpected game-day attractions that are memorable and succeed
      at capturing the attention of passive fans.





      Foodies are sports fans too.





      The rise of the foodie has had a profound effect on food culture, and this
      impact has resonated within ballparks and stadiums. Discerning consumers
      not only want to try unique fare, but also want to be inspired with every
      bite they take – and this interest has extended far beyond restaurants. Ty
      Cobb is probably rolling in his grave watching baseball fans nosh on quinoa
      and truffle fries within the sacred grounds of America's ballparks. Of
      course, encouraging passive fans to spend money at those same ballparks
      would contribute to his salary were he still playing today.





      The growth of on-demand.





      The explosion of the on-demand economy has placed everything from car
      services to home improvement just a tap away.​

      On-demand is partially the reason why more stadiums are offering in-seat
      wait staff service. The other reason rests firmly on the idea that spending
      good money on decent seats should also bring with it an elevated level of
      service.





      On a recent trip to Yankee Stadium, I was somewhat surprised by the
      prevalence of these elevated experiences. Having visited stadiums in
      Seattle, Houston, Chicago, Baltimore and DC, I knew what to expect. But the
      Bronx Bombers' home still offered some surprises. From wait staff serving
      large sections of box seats, to concession menus offering chef-inspired
      fare, the shift toward upscale was highly visible. It was also effective.
      I brought along a friend whose interest in baseball is minimal. However,
      the various food and beer offerings piqued his interest to the point where
      he spent an entire inning cruising the concourse just to see what he could
      find.





      On our way to the train after the game, I wanted to gauge his experience.
      On the positive side he raved about the food options, and how going to
      a game now is so much better than he remembered from his childhood. Would
      he go again? "Absolutely," he replied. "I'll be honest, the game was super
      boring, but the food was incredible."





      The bottom line.





      More than ever before, stadium operators are approaching their challenge
      the same way that successful brands tackle their business – by crafting an
      experience where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Giving
      people an excuse to indulge in a sporting event means demonstrating the
      worth of the entire in-stadium experience.





      In an age where our entertainment options are growing daily, enticing new
      attendees while retaining existing fans means raising the bar and expanding
      the experience. Just make sure the next time you visit a stadium you bring
      plenty of cash and a healthy appetite.​
