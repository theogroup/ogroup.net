      Me: "I'm visiting Dress Bar today!"





      Colleague: "Dress Barn? Why would you go to Dress Barn?"





      Me: "No, Dress BAR"





      Colleague: "Oh okay! So what's Dress Bar?"





      Me: "Well, it's a pop up. From Dress Barn."





      Colleague: "…"





      I had this conversation a number of times leading up to my first visit to
      Dress Bar. Each time it would end in a bit of confusion about whether
      a pop-up concept from strip-mall retailer Dress Barn could really win over
      trend-conscious New York City shoppers.





      As I was walking up toward Madison Square Park on an errand a few weeks ago
      I spotted their storefront, and made a note to return later (and Google
      "Dress Bar", of course). Admittedly, I knew very little about parent brand
      Dress Barn going into this. Unsurprising, since as a millennial I fall
      rather far from their target consumer (35+ "career-women"). After some
      online research, I get the feeling that Dress Barn falls somewhere below
      Anne Taylor LOFT in terms of both price and style-consciousness. Armed with
      my newfound knowledge of the brand, and rather impressed by their website
      given my memories of poorly lit storefronts glimpsed from afar, I convinced
      two colleagues to join me at an upcoming Dress Bar brand event, "Sip. Shop.
      Be Glam."​





      We went. We saw. We sipped champagne. The brand really delivered on
      a "shopping and drinks with your girlfriends" experience. I will say that
      we were perhaps the youngest attendees, with the average age hovering
      around 40. The line to check out was constantly busy, and at points it was
      crowded enough to make it difficult to move. The DJ they hired for the
      event was an Instagram influencer, an appeal that might have been lost on
      the audience filling the space, but a strategic tactic nonetheless.​

      Dress Bar is an effort from Dress Barn to return to being "known for the
      dress," as shared with me by a sales person. Will it be successful? I think
      Dress Bar is a great example of a brand making an effort to expand its
      target consumer base and build brand equity without alienating its core
      consumer. I think key to Dress Barn's success here is their effort to not
      alienate their current consumer—Dress Bar is a smart evolution precisely
      because prices have remained stable (as compared to Dress Barn stores),
      featured styles are trend-conscious while still a bit conservative, and
      sizes are extremely inclusionary (ranging from 2-24), as is typical of the
      brand.​





      The pop-up itself provides an updated shopping experience (collection
      driven merchandising and iPads for ordering product unavailable on the
      floor) and a curated group of higher-end products aimed at bringing
      relevant parts of the Dress Barn brand DNA to a younger and/or more
      influential consumer who will be key to the brand's future success. I say
      "younger", but I don't mean "young." Dress Bar and Dress Barn's consumer is
      decidedly not 25 years old, but with this new concept I wouldn't be
      surprised if they've begun to broaden their reach into the upper millennial
      generation (early 30s).​





      Perhaps most interesting to me about this entire concept is the push toward
      shifting the perception of Dress Barn from affordable and practical toward
      style-driven and higher-end. Of course the product featured is the result
      of designer-collaborations and a higher price point than much of their
      other merchandise, which sets the tone, but more compelling is that the way
      the pop-up shop behaves mimics a higher-end department store (designer
      appearances, events, alignment with charities / causes, adjacent category
      collaborations). The space itself is more of an experience shop than simply
      a "store", and on that level I think Dress Bar has far outdone many
      retailers who fail to see the opportunity a physical spaces provides for
      real consumer engagement and feedback.





      I for one am looking forward to seeing Dress Bar interact with New York
      City through upcoming events – and perhaps a shorter line at their next
      (fingers crossed) collaboration with Benefit Brow Bar!​
