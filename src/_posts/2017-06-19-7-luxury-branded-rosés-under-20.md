      Most are likely dryer than you think, so they pair perfectly with grilled
      foods. But what is so right about Ros&eacute; this time of year is what it
      says about those who choose to enjoy it. Why? Ros&eacute;s just don't have
      to be expensive to be great.





      With a bit of forethought and discernment, the right choice can set the
      tone for an amazing summertime experience. Savvy hosts and party goers can
      make the right impression – without overdoing it – by choosing a very
      affordable Ros&eacute; that looks just as high-end as it tastes. So without
      further ado, my recommendations for the 7 best luxury-branded ros&eacute;s
      under $20.





      Thanks to the Wine Library for all of your help shopping for these featured
      wines. All prices are rounded to the nearest dollar.





      ESPOR&Atilde;O VINHA DA DEFESA 2014 // PORTUGAL // $10





      This Aragonez Syrah has super sleek graphics and very modern feel. Thin
      horizontal lines replace a paper label and provide a background for the
      gold foil-stamped logotype. This design is perfect for the urban modernist
      looking to stand out from the crowd.





      LA MOULINI&Egrave;RE BORDEAUX ROS&Eacute; 2014 // FRANCE // $11





      A very classically-inspired label design clearly takes pride in its
      Bordeaux terroir. With a sophisticated engraving-style illustration of the
      winemakers' maison and formal, serif typography, this Cabernet Franc and
      Merlot blend whispers with a quiet confidence.





      JOSEP FORASTER ROSAT TREPAT 2014 // SPAIN // $13





      A modern and minimal coat-of-arms and clean, sans-serif type makes this
      bottle appear attractive and upscale, yet very approachable (even if you've
      never heard of the Trepat grape). It's unusual and intriguing. Grounded in
      history yet very contemporary in its look.





      L'OLIVETO ROS&Eacute; OF PINOT NOIR 2014 // CALIFORNIA // $13





      Strong. Simple. Confident. This label design exudes quality, especially the
      use of subtly textured cream paper. A logo featuring a modern illustration
      of an olive tree and mountain combines with bold serifed type and earthy
      browns and green. This bottle would look great in any setting.





      CH&Acirc;TEAU DE BEAUPR&Eacute; 2013 // FRANCE // $14





      Classic in every conceivable way, this bottle looks like it costs more than
      its actual price. A vintage woodcut illustration of the maison combines
      with an engraving-styled open typeface to evoke a very rich feel.
      Representing a combination of Grenache, Syrah and Consult, this design
      direction would likely appeal to wine purists and Francophiles.





      DOMAINE CHANDON ROS&Eacute; // CALIFORNIA // $17





      This special edition sparkling Ros&eacute; basically jumped off of the
      shelf and into my cart screaming, "Let's have fun!"​





      Wrapped in pink and white stripes, it just feels fresh – like the perfect
      summertime bottle to pop. This bottle design is perfect for fashionistas
      and fun-seekers.





      CAVES D'ESCLANS WHISPERING ANGEL // FRANCE // $19





      Totally stunning. A custom coat of arms molded into the glass,
      phantom-printed cherubs on a textured label, flowing script typography and
      a small, gold coat arms have already made this design a popular choice this
      season. It feels so highly considered and high-end.





      The name also, is clearly distinctive within the category. Serve or gift
      this to impress guests or hosts.​
