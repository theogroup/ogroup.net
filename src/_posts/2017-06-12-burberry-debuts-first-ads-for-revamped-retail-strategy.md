      "Burberry’s consolidation of its three brands into the single ‘Burberry’
      label is a move toward streamlining brand communications for consumers
      — one which we have seen echoed across the industry by brands such as Ralph
      Lauren, who consolidated its Black label to alleviate some confusion," said
      Kristen Dillman, business development manager at The O Group, New York.

      "Burberry’s decision to avoid categorizing the latest campaign by season is
      an interesting move," Ms. Dillman said. "Removing the season label from the
      campaign is a smart transition toward continued promotion of Burberry as
      forward-thinking. After all, people still look to heritage luxury brands to
      lead the charge, and this effort from Burberry to move past seasonal labels
      may prove to be at the forefront of what’s next in luxury."
