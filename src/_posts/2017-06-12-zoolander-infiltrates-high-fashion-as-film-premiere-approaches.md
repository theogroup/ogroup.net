      The Zoolander sequel has now been associated with Italian fashion house,
      Valentino, the latest issue of Vogue Magazine and a number of fashion and
      Hollywood darlings. What does it all mean?









      "When Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson appeared unannounced at the Valentino
      show for the first time in 2015, there was a sense of surprise, delight and
      self-effacing humor from the luxury fashion community, which often—just
      like Hollywood—takes itself a bit seriously," said Kristen Dillman,
      business development manager at The O Group, New York.​

      "So when a storied luxury house like Valentino takes a step back from its
      carefully cultivated veneer to embrace popular culture it feels fresh and
      modern. The press surrounding the second Zoolander movie has mention of
      just about every of-the-moment fashion, Hollywood and music celeb and will
      likely expose new audiences to the Valentino brand, growing its
      aspirational following and propping up its actual ready-to-wear business."
