      Currently she is directing the newly formed partnership of fine jewelry
      designer Angela Cummings and Assael.

      **ORIT**: WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

      Mickey Ateyeh: In the South of France in Saint-R&eacute;my – a charming and
      beautiful small village in Provence.

      **ORIT**: I LOVE YOU, BUT I'M A HATER RIGHT NOW.

      Mickey: I see you love the South of France as much as I do!

      **ORIT**: SO WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES YOU SEE LUXURY BRANDS FACING?

      Mickey: In my opinion, one of the biggest challenges for Luxury Brands is
      to try to maintain a position in the market place while retaining their
      original vision through innovation. It's clearly not an easy thing to do!
      It's also important for the luxury sector to differentiate "true" luxury
      and "affordable" luxury. The more brands define all of these aspects, the
      more the market will evolve and grow.

      **ORIT**: HOW DO YOU DEFINE "TRUE" VERSUS "AFFORDABLE" LUXURY?

      Mickey: Luxury is absolutely in the eye of the consumer. That said,
      traditionally "true" luxury can be defined by recognizable design, premium
      quality material, and exclusive distribution. Immediately you might think
      of Hermes (my former employer), Van Cleef & Arpels or Breguet. In today's
      luxury market, performance is also an important factor, and perhaps price
      is not the only element to be considered.

      Concerning what is referred to as "affordable" luxury, it's an exciting
      category for many reasons. It's defined by signature style, but produced in
      a more competitive manner that results in a more reasonable price
      structure. If we substitute the word "affordable" with "aspirational", it
      then defines both the brand and the market segment. There is absolutely no
      better example of this than J. Crew. They've mastered it all – branding,
      styling, quality and pricing. It's pure genius, obviously accompanied by
      hard work, vision and dedication!

      **ORIT**: SO IF WE SPEAK TO TRUE LUXURY, THE BRANDS THAT HAVE HERITAGE AND
      CRAFTSMANSHIP MIGHT BE WITHERING ON THE VINE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED
      OUT HOW TO CONNECT WITH THE MARKET?

      Mickey: Exactly right. Perhaps they've not yet been able to effectively
      reach a new consumer who is just venturing into luxury purchasing. This is
      where Burberry has truly excelled by expanding into new and younger product
      lines that are still luxurious and keep within their identity. As a result
      their sales performance is outstanding, not to mention their escalating
      stock price.

      **ORIT**: WE SPOKE WITH JEFF PRINE, A WRITER WHO WORKS SPECIFICALLY IN THE
      JEWELRY AND WATCH SPACE, AND HE CALLED OUT BURBERRY IN THE SAME WAY YOU
      HAVE. SO IT SEEMS YOU WOULD CALL THEM BEST IN CLASS? THEY'VE NEVER WALKED
      AWAY FROM WHAT THEY'VE ALWAYS STOOD FOR, BUT THEY'VE CERTAINLY BEEN
      INNOVATIVE AND COHESIVE IN THEIR MESSAGING AND OFFERING.

      Mickey: Agree with Jeff completely. It is the heart of their success and
      accounts for their impressive results. They have clearly mastered the world
      of social media and have put together an enchanting advertising campaign.
      In addition, the appeal of the Burberry Porsum Collection has engaged an
      entirely new clientele. So, yes, best in class!

      **ORIT**: WHAT OTHER BRANDS WOULD YOU PUT UP ON THAT SAME PEDESTAL?

      Mickey: Certainly C&eacute;line. Phoebe Philo, creative director, to me is
      a design genius and innovator extraordinaire. The C&eacute;line bag with
      signature opening gussets is unique, novel and stunningly attractive. She
      created a modern icon, which has already been reinterpreted by many
      admiring designers.

      **ORIT**: SO IF WE TALK ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR OF SUCCESS IN
      A BRAND, YOU'VE CALLED OUT HAVING A VISION, INNOVATION, MESSAGING…

      Mickey: It still all goes back to one thing: design, which is the hub of
      any true luxury business.​

      **ORIT**: SO WHAT'S "NEW" OUT THERE, HOW ARE BRANDS INNOVATING?

      Mickey: One brand I see as new is the expansion of Belstaff – the British
      leather clothing and accessory company that has recently opened a Flagship
      on Madison Avenue in New York City. The product quality is extraordinary.
      It will be interesting to follow their development.

      Regarding innovation, it is an interesting question and being here in
      Europe gives me a different perspective. For example, today in a small shop
      in Avignon I found some of the most fabulous Martin Margiela designs. This
      is not something I've personally seen in the U.S. He is an innovator and
      a visionary.

      And speaking of visionaries, it's a pleasure and an honor to be virtually
      in the backyard of one of world's greatest and talented designers:
      Christian Lacroix.

      **ORIT**: SO IT SEEMS THERE'S A LINE IN THE SAND WITH WHAT YOU SEE IN
      EUROPE AS COMPARED TO WHAT WE SEE HERE IN THE U.S.—DO YOU FEEL THAT THE
      RETAILER HAS BECOME AFRAID OF PUSHING THE LIMITS OF DESIGN?

      Mickey: No, it is my feeling that the U.S. retailer reaches as far as they
      can for their consumer. It's important to remember that the U.S. market
      differs from the European market. There are a few superb examples of
      retailers here that continually try to bring new product to their clients:
      Barney's in NYC and LA and Bergdorf Goodman in New York City.

      The difficulty for retailers today comes down to pure financial
      performance, as witnessed by the imminent takeovers of both Neiman Marcus
      and Saks.

      **ORIT**: DO YOU THINK THAT THERE WILL BE A RESURGENCE OF SMALL BOUTIQUES
      BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TIRING OF THE TYPICAL SELECTION IN BIGGER RETAILERS?

      Mickey: I do not necessarily think that we'll see an expansion in this
      sector, as the investment for a start-up is significant. I do think,
      however, that we have quite a few well regarded specialty stores, such as
      Ikram in Chicago, Maxfield's in LA, Linda Dresner in Birmingham, MI,
      Mario's in Seattle, Richard's in Greenwich, Mitchells in Westport and
      finally Opening Ceremony and Kirna Zabete in NYC.

      **ORIT**: TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ACCESSORIES MARKET.

      Mickey: Accessories are the driving force of retail fashion today. No
      designer has created a more brilliant Accessory Division than Michael Kors.
      In general, it does seem easier to sell a handbag at $750 than to sell
      clothing at two or three times that cost.

      Speaking of handbags, the other day I saw such a fabulous, graphic and
      creative ad for the new Jonathan Adler handbag collection and thought how
      fun and how clever. Good for him!

      **ORIT**: LET'S SHIFT A BIT AND TALK ABOUT THE CUSTOMER—WHAT ARE THEY
      EXPECTING OF LUXURY BRANDS?

      The treatment, recognition and pure enjoyment of choosing an enduring
      product, whether it be an Angela Cummings for Assael South Sea pearl and
      diamond necklace or a custom made pair of John Lobb shoes, becomes as much
      about the item as the moment of purchase.

      **ORIT**: HOW IMPORTANT IS EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE FROM THE ENTIRE PIPELINE OF
      THE BRAND?

      Mickey: It is all-important and reverts directly back to the point of sale.
      Ideally, there is a consistent brand message successfully communicated by
      informed and knowledgeable sales associates. This is a reason to frequent
      brick and mortar stores, as opposed to solely shopping virtually online.

      **ORIT**: STAYING THERE FOR A MOMENT—WHAT BRANDS DO YOU THINK ARE GETTING
      IT RIGHT FROM A DIGITAL POINT OF VIEW? WHO'S TRANSLATED THEIR BRAND TO THE
      ONLINE EXPERIENCE?

      Mickey: Burberry, again – everyone seems to find their website compelling.
      Of course, on a totally different level there is the fabulous
      Net-A-Porter.

      **ORIT**: YOU'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN JEWELRY, ACCESSORIES AND FASHION, SO
      WHAT STILL EXCITES YOU OUT THERE?

      Mickey: The energy of creative, new, young designers in every field of
      fashion, architecture and home design.

      **ORIT**: SO WHAT ARE YOUR PERSONAL LUXURIES, APART FROM TRAVEL!

      Mickey: A Remy chardonnay, great dinners with friends and the ability to
      support the charities and causes nearest to my heart.

      Q&O is a series of short conversations with friends and colleagues, all
      experts in their industry, about what it really takes to make luxury brands
      tick. Through this series of interviews, I'm hoping to not only pull back
      the curtain on luxury (just a little!), but connect insights across the
      Fashion, Jewelry, Hospitality and Spirits industries, and talk about what's
      next.
