However, since then there’s been a steady decline in super yacht sales according to data collected by [BOAT](http://www.boatinternational.com/yacht-market-intelligence/superyacht-industry-data/superyacht-sales-data/superyachts-sold-in-2010--25667) magazine.​'

      ***Sailing vs Owning***

      Younger members of the ultra-wealthy elite seem to find ownership restrictive, while the older ultra-wealthy are becoming trepidatious about purchases of this magnitude due to how financially demanding it is after the initial purchase. What this means is that although the novelty of owning a yacht has lost its luster, it does not really signal the end for the super yacht industry. In fact, this might be the time for a rebirth. Luxury consumers have become more careful with retail purchases over the past seven years, but if the statistics from Eventbrite’s “Fueling The Experiential Economy" report are anything to go by, the future of yachting lies in experiences and not ownership. As it stands there has been an increase in fractional yacht ownership, but even this method of ownership is somewhat limiting in terms of offerings and experiences. Most importantly, it is ownership, not an experience.​

      What the yachting industry might want to look into is more collaborative
      luxury experiences that are not just limited to the traditional charter
      models. Aside from boat shows in the summer, there also seems to be a lack
      of luxury brand partnerships offering a contemporary sailing experience
      that would make consumers open the deepest crevasse of their wallets.
      A great example of new luxury experiences that speak to a sense of
      adventure, is one created by Volvo in partnership with technology brand
      Tablet, called the pop-up “Get Away Lodge”. The duo created an exclusive
      winter cabin experience that featured a free test drive and unique designer
      d&eacute;cor.

















      In marketing, we often refer to uncharted territories as “blue water.”
      Perhaps the time has come for the yachting industry to start exploring
      their own blue water by offering luxury consumers new, curated experiences.
      There are a plethora of luxury brands that would jump at the chance to
      partner up with a luxury boating brand to offer unique marine experiences.
      This might be the approach that can breathe new life into the luxury
      boating industry, the success of which won’t solely depend on sales.​
