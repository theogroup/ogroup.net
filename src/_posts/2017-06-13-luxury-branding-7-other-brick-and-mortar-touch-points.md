For better or worse, "Branding" has become a part of the everyday vernacular and as such, it has grown exponentially broader and deeper.​'

      Earlier today I spent the morning walking The Mall at Short Hills, focused
      on identifying and experiencing some of the more nuanced and subtle Luxury
      brand retail touchpoints exclusive to brick-and-mortar locations.

      **TEMPERATURE & CLIMATE**

      This is a summer-themed blog post, so it's not surprising that the first
      thing I notice when I enter is the difference in temperature and humidity.
      Clearly, we all expect the temperature to be controlled inside but when the
      mercury (and humidity) rise outside, the contrast is even more noticeable.
      Should retail brands take advantage of scorchers and rainy days? I think
      so. Affluent shoppers like little perks as much as anyone (in fact, they
      expect them). Some stores offer small bottles of water. While the practice
      isn't very eco-friendly, I really appreciate it. I feel like the brand is
      thanking me for braving the weather and that I'm truly welcome. Oh, and
      ready to shop.

      **LIGHTING**

      I'm amazed at how much lighting differs from store to store. Whether
      bright, soft, dim, backlit or otherwise, all substantially impact the
      shopping and by proxy, the brand experience. Surprisingly, there are
      a number of stores whose lighting is not at all flattering to the products
      and fixtures.

      Personally, I'm more comfortable shopping in a well-lit store. It seems
      obvious, but I've had too many mishaps in the past where in the light of
      day, my purchases lost their luster.

      **MUSIC & SOUND**

      I know that most people are aware of background music on some level. As
      I walk from store to store, I wonder how much in-store sound affects and
      informs shoppers. I pick up on the overall ambient sounds. Does every brand
      have some optimum decibel level?​

      I quickly learn that focusing solely on music and moving quickly through
      the mall is like hitting the Random play button on someone else's iPod.

      I can say that I definitely prefer music that's a bit more recognizable
      (real songs played on actual instruments) to a lot of what I heard
      (watered-down hits and spa-themed "whoosh-tings"). In-store audio has to be
      on brand. The volume and tempo must instantly appeal to the target
      consumer, otherwise it's just noise.

      **SCENT**

      When done right, scent can be a powerful branding tool. There are
      instances, however, when it's a huge turn-off. Aside from Department
      Stores, I recognize that there are (mostly fashion) brands out there that
      do big business in fragrance, so they pump their stores full of perfume and
      cologne. For me, it's just way too over the top and aggressive. If I can
      smell it from across the mall, it's too much. (This applies to individuals
      too, but we all know that, right?) I prefer stores with a clean, light,
      invigorating scent. Also the coffee, tea, and chocolate stores where scent
      and smell really had some appetite appeal make perfect sense. (Side note:
      I've read that Scent will be an option on upcoming Mercedes Benz models.
      Stay tuned.)

      **ATTITUDE & APPROACHABILITY**

      To be clear, I'm at the mall at 10:00am on a weekday. That being said, I'm
      being greeted, welcomed and chatted up at virtually every store I visit.
      This is big. I don't look sloppy, but I'm dressed very casually. Again,
      I feel fairly well taken care of. Because I'm accustomed to shopping on the
      weekends, I feel like I've got some sort of VIP pass. The salespeople seem
      happy to help. The experience is more collaborative. I could get used to
      this. In fact, I'm thinking back to times I've participated in private,
      pre-opening sales (no, not Black Friday) and when they're done right, how
      they can be a totally different, very pleasurable experience.

      **SAMPLING & THRESHOLD**

      I walk past a tea store that consistently offers samples to passers-by. I'm
      glad that other shoppers seem into it, but I'm not a huge fan of their tea
      and wasn't interested. I support the idea of brands offering something in
      exchange for my attention (or my information, like an email or address),
      but in the brick-and-mortar Luxury environment this kind of overt wrangling
      feels not quite right. Contrast that with fragrance-sampling, which seems
      to have finally understood that not everyone is interested in getting
      spritzed.​

      In the tea example, the brand is physically calling out to me and making me
      accept or refuse the offer. In the fragrance case, I've already entered the
      store. It's subtle, but I had to walk past one store, and had chosen to
      enter the other. When I opt in, it's OK to ask. When I'm walking by, I feel
      I've been put in the uncomfortable position of saying no. To me, that's
      poor engagement.

      **LOCATION & SETTING (SIGNAGE, DISPLAY & VIDEO)**

      I begin to discern loose sections or "neighborhoods" in the mall. For
      example, there are parts of the mall that feature a higher concentration of
      European fashion and jewelry brands, as opposed to areas where stores with
      more accessible price points are located. Makes sense. There are
      similarities too, in how these stores are designed and merchandised. These
      stores and brands reflect on each other. Even within an enclosed
      environment, it's the whole "company you keep" mentality.

      Three hours flies by when all you do is walk the mall trying to read
      between the lines and make interesting connections.​
