  There is much to learn for all brand categories by looking at a new
  perspective.​

      A high-minded approach, elevated aesthetics, and an unwavering dedication
      to a carefully crafted brand ethos are no longer purely the domain of
      old-world heritage brands. The lines between luxury, prestige and mass
      have been altered by a number of factors, allowing brands of all kinds to
      successfully emulate luxury tactics. Chief among the learnings brands of
      all types can and should take from the realm of luxury is the development
      of an intense focus on the consumer.&nbsp;

      Many businesses attempt to sell purely through product attributes, and
      that’s fine if you’re selling a commodity. Brands who additionally
      communicate luxury-branding characteristics can more easily evoke the
      proper balance of rational and emotional cues in order to resonate with
      consumers, demand higher prices and earn loyalty.​

      Articulating a rich description of the target based on real people and
      research is the key to developing messaging that hits home with your
      audience. A careful balance of the rational and emotional elements that
      meet your consumer’s needs cannot be developed without the creation of an
      in-depth target profile.

      Through the creation of a strategic target persona, assumptions can be
      confirmed (if not formally tested) and brands begin to take shape. Along
      these same lines, it is crucial to consider both demographics and
      psychographics in crafting a functional target profile. Brands have to
      know their targets inside and out in order align themselves properly
      across numerous touchpoints.​

      Focusing on the lifestyle benefits to consumers, rather than
      fatigue-inducing product attributes or amenities lists, is another luxury
      branding best practice that any and every brand can use to their benefit.
      While explaining technical details, unique offerings or different uses is
      certainly necessary, in the absence of a vastly superior product,
      articulating how those attributes come together to provide something
      special is what separates messaging from marketing.

      Luxury Automotive has been capitalizing on this understanding since at
      least the 1980’s. From Porsche’s, "Often Imitated but Never Duplicated,"
      and BMW’s, "The Ultimate Driving Machine," to Cadillac’s, "Dare Greatly,"
      and Lincoln’s, "The Feeling Stays," there is much to learn for other brand
      categories. Luxury car brands don’t run window stickers as ad creative.
      And they don’t just give the 0-60 times and MPG stats. They tell us how
      we’ll feel, how we’ll be viewed by others or what they’ll make us believe
      we can attain or have achieved. Focus on lifestyle benefits, not product
      attributes, and you’re well on your way to communicating at a higher level
      and captivating a sophisticated consumer.​

      The luxury industry has always been dedicated to connecting with consumers
      and addressing their needs. Now, brands of all types who execute
      successfully via social media can cultivate meaningful connections with
      consumers, even on a personal level.

      In the instant-access world of social, consumers and brands are on equal
      footing. Ritz Carlton Hotels exemplifies this with their 150K followers on
      Instagram. The account is almost entirely composed of guest photos as part
      of their #RCMemories campaign. Ritz Carlton virtually ensures a positive
      relationship and implies that anyone can have a memorable stay by
      collaborating with users (guests) to co-create its’ Instagram feed.

      The key takeaway? It’s all about your consumer, all the time, no matter
      whether you’re mass or luxury or somewhere in-between. Brands who properly
      balance rational and emotional elements, focus on lifestyle benefits
      versus amenities and connect authentically on social media can create for
      themselves the opportunity to be considered among the world’s elite
      brands, regardless of their category or market position.​
