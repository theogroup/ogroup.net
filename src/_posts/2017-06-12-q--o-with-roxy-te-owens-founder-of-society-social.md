  Roxy Owens has had a knack for furniture design from a very young age. With her
  parents launching their home line right out of college, Roxy spent the majority
  of her childhood wandering through the aisles of trade shows. As student out of
  college, Roxy decided she would pursue a career as a fashion buyer however she
  quickly realized it was not her life’s desire. After quitting her then job and
  starting her blog, Roxy would later launch her very own furniture
  line,&nbsp;[Society Social](http://www.shopsocietysocial.com/)&nbsp;in August,
  2011.

  Society Social's colorful collection of bar carts, cocktail tables, and
  entertaining accouterments aplenty has caught the eye of many, including HGTV,
  Lonny, House Beautiful, and Southern Living.

  And today we had the opportunity to chat with the amazingly talented Roxy Te
  Owens to discuss how furniture design has inspired her life’s purpose.​

      **Orit**: Who is Roxy Te Owens?

      **Roxy:**&nbsp;I'm an ex-corporate rat racer, turned self-proclaimed dream
      chaser! Right out of Parsons The New School, I eagerly started my career as
      a fashion buyer. Despite being 100% confident I had made the right career
      choice, I quickly found that cubicle life was not for me.

      Having grown up in North Carolina around the furniture industry – my
      brother and I actually spent the first few years of our childhood living in
      our family’s factory. When we were just starting out it felt natural to go
      back to my roots. Enter Society Social, purveyor of bar carts and colorful
      home furnishings!

      **Orit:** Where did the idea for Society Social come from? And where does
      the name come from?

      **Roxy:**&nbsp;I’m so inspired by life’s shared moments. Whether it’s
      a raucous party or a quiet night at home spent with loved ones, furniture
      is going to be present in some way. I really try to put love into each
      piece, and it’s truly an honor when I receive notes and pictures from my
      customer. “Your Sedgewick bar cart made it just in time for my bridal
      shower!” In a small way I get to contribute to these social, celebratory
      and shared moments that make life special. The name Society Social is a nod
      to that!

      **Orit:** What was the first item you created?

      **Roxy:**&nbsp;The bar cart! Prior to Society Social and even now, I read
      design blogs constantly. I noticed everyone was talking about the bar cart,
      but nobody could really tell you where to buy one that wasn’t either
      extremely high end or vintage and on its last wheel. I knew there was a gap
      in the market that I could go after, I latched onto it, and when launching
      in August 2011 my tag line was “the bar cart is back!” I’ve since expanded
      my categories, but I got my start by identifying a need in the market and
      then making a strong stand to provide for that need. Focusing on one design
      helped my quick notoriety verses launching with multiple products. I can
      proudly say, 5 years later the bar cart is definitely back. I don’t think
      there is a retailer who doesn’t have a version of their own! Our Sedgewick
      remains a bestseller since day 1!

      **Orit:** What is the inspiration behind your designs?

      **Roxy:**&nbsp;Growing up in a home that loves to celebrate. To me a happy
      home has always meant that decorating and entertaining go hand in hand. And
      by this I mean, everyone should want and enjoy creating a warm, inviting
      environment to share with friends and family. Whether on quiet nights in or
      bigger nights celebrating the most important things in life.

      These are values I instill into each Society Social piece. Home furnishings
      inspired by shared celebrations whether big or small. From the booze-tastic
      bar carts for the ultimate hostess to the stylish, yet affordable sofas
      where there is always a seat for you and the person you would most love to
      have sitting right beside you!

      **Orit**: What are some of your favorite Luxury brands and why?

      **Roxy:&nbsp;**Nicolas Feuillatte Brut Rose—it’s a little luxury I shall
      never tire of. It’s delicate and delicious and worth every penny!

      Loeffler Randall—I have a closet full! These shoes are stylish, timeless,
      and undoubtedly well made.

      Self-Portrait—If I have to make an appearance, you will most likely find me
      in one of their dresses. The line is full of showstoppers in style and
      quality (the dresses I own are actually heavy!) and at a price point that
      is more than fair for what you get. I have started a collection!

      **Orit:** What is it like working with your brother?

      **Roxy:**&nbsp;Simultaneously amazing and tricky! We have a great
      relationship and have always been very close, but just like any normal
      brother/sister dynamic, sometimes we duke it out! Thankfully, it’s never
      anything that can’t be solved at happy hour!

      **Orit:** How has social media impacted the growth of Society Social?

      **Roxy:**&nbsp;Social media has been a tremendous tool in helping me grow
      Society Social without spending boatloads on advertising. We’re able to
      share new arrivals as soon as they hit, behind the scenes moments that put
      a face to the company, and it’s also just a fun and instant way to talk to
      and engage with our sweet customers!

      **Orit:** Tell us what’s next?

      **Roxy:&nbsp;**We have a few big collaborations in the works and I hope
      they’ll show another side of Society Social that the world hasn’t seen yet!
      With that said, I believe it’s so important to not only focus on the next
      goal but to enjoy the journey, too!
