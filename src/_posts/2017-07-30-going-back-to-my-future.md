  Most stories we know follow the expected format of a beginning, middle and an end, correct? Well…this one strays a bit from the expected.&nbsp;

      25 years ago I accepted my first job as a Creative Director in New York
      City. This beautiful pregnant woman named Orit (like Cher - no last name)
      said my portfolio “haunted” her, and asked if I would like to come work
      with her at her growing branding agency as the Creative Director. I was
      flattered, naturally - no one had ever mentioned a metaphysical connection
      to my work before and I said yes on the spot. My time at her branding
      agency, The O Group was one of the most rewarding of my career and after
      4 years together, it was time for me to move on to new challenges.&nbsp;

      In 1997, the digital medium was starting to gain traction in the agency
      world. I was keenly interested, so after The O Group I joined interactive
      team Ogilvy as a Creative Supervisor in the New York City office. The new
      medium was thrilling and as IBM as a key client, the creative work was
      challenging and juicy. After 11 years living in NYC it was time for me to
      move on and shortly after that decision was made I was recruited by Mullen
      just outside of Boston to join their team as VP, Interactive Creative
      Director. General Motors, Four Seasons Hotels, Coca Cola, The Oprah Network
      were just some of the mega brands I helped develop digital creative efforts
      for over the next few years. Career life was great - my personal life, not
      so much. I missed living closer to my family in Seattle and the West Coast
      in general, so in 2001 I packed up and moved back to Washington
      State.&nbsp;

      **Go West (Youngish) Man**


      After 5 more years at two great Seattle agencies (Cole & Webber and Hornall
      Anderson) leading creative efforts for clients like Nike, Starbucks, AT&T
      Wireless, Microsoft and the ACLU it was time for me to strike out on my own
      and in 2006 I started an independent branding practice. Over the next 10
      years, my business and the size of my client base grew to include many
      respected brands such as the Space Needle, the Museum of History and
      Industry, Glass Vodka, DRY Soda, and Chihuly Garden and Glass - Seattle’s
      number one tourist destination since 2014. Having my own branding practice
      has been the greatest creative and business challenge of my career; I’ve
      loved every part of it except one - working alone can be pretty isolating.

      **The Return of O**






      Over the next 20 years Orit and I kept in touch on a regular basis, so
      I was not surprised to hear from her a month ago. Cutting to the point like
      a true New Yorker, she told me she was looking to change her current
      traditional agency model and wanted to work side-by-side with a creative
      partner on select clients only - and that partner she had in mind was the
      friendly ghost from her past - moi.&nbsp;

      Without the need for tedious and in-depth soul searching - her invitation
      to get the band back together was met with a firm “Hell, Yes.” I didn’t
      need to second-guess myself because I believe when you find a relationship
      that really works on all levels, you’ve struck gold. I’ve always been
      amazed just how these special connections (business or personal) can last
      a lifetime, even with large gaps between seeing each other and can be
      brought back to life faster than a New York minute.&nbsp;

      My past has literally become my present and future. I became Partner and
      CCO at The O Group and lead the West Coast office in Seattle, appropriately
      labeled O Group West.&nbsp;

      Who says you can’t go back? Having just one path ahead seems so
      shortsighted and single minded. From now on, I’m going to consider all
      directions up for grabs and open for business.&nbsp;
