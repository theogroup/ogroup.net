      "In a sporting era where players, coaches and sponsors in every league
      around the world are constantly on the move, reaching 10 years of steady
      dedication and support is admirable and noteworthy," said Patrick Lorentz,
      strategy director at The O Group, New York. "It certainly doesn’t hurt that
      Hublot’s 10 years of sponsorship is attached to the world’s biggest and
      most popular sport, (soccer / football)."









      "The "What is your Euro moment" concept leverages the idea of moments in
      time, but in a way that should resonate with passionate fans. There are
      specific football moments that will live on forever – not just for the
      players, coaches and referees, but for the fans as well. By highlighting
      these moments delivered by legends of the game, Hublot is creating
      a connection between the past and today, and between players and fans."​

      "Hublot can only continue to grow through its relationship with the
      beautiful game," Mr. Lorentz said. "Millions – if not billions – of fans
      around the world will continue to be exposed to the brand. Hublot will be
      a part of stories, plays and moments that will be shared and debated in
      pubs, on fields and in homes around the world for years to come."
