  *By Daymon Bruck*


  A Seventeenth century Japanese Tea master Naosuke coined one of the most
  common Zen phrases: **Ichi-go ichi-e,** which is often translated to “once in
  the lifetime, never again”. The intended meaning of this phrase is that every
  experience we have is unique and can’t be repeated. We only have one life and
  every day, encounter and experience is one of a kind. Once time passes it
  never will be recaptured and this quintessence makes Time the ultimate measure
  of true value; you can’t make any more of it or bend it to your will. Or can
  you?&nbsp;


  A new experience economy has been steadily emerging and with it a sense of
  what else might come to define the luxury category. This newish luxury is all
  about rare and privileged experiences available for a price. At the center of
  many of these exclusive events or experiences is a unique benefit of
  leveraging time in some manner: saving it, making the most of it, slowing it
  down, even sidestepping its normal flow altogether. It makes sense that Time
  is becoming more highly valued than money as a luxury indicator, especially
  considering time’s finite quantity. Luxury brands are awakening to this shift
  and those that cater to making the most of their customers’ need to control
  their personal time are differentiating from the those that only focus on
  products or services.&nbsp; &nbsp;


  I’ve collected some examples that are grouped in this article under two
  general categories: the value of Slow Time (Part 1 in the series) and Faster
  than “Normal” Time (Part 2 in the series). This first looks at the how Luxury
  uses values associated with slowing down or aging to differentiate and the
  second posting will focus on examples of moving faster than or even bypassing
  everyday timeframes.

      *Part 1: &nbsp;The Luxury of Slow Time*


      &nbsp;


      **The Older the Better**


      The notion that slowness comes into direct conflict with the values of our
      digital economy is of course not true for all luxury goods and services.
      Over the years we have helped many clients with epicurean and hand-crafted
      products use the terms “slow-cured” or “handmade” to translate a value of
      time being applied to a product which benefits from the aging process.
      Fine wines, whiskey, cheeses and cigars all benefit from having been held
      back, forcing us to wait for the ultimate experience at the height of
      their fullness.


      When new products and technologies are being released on an almost daily
      schedule, the allure of a special and rare thing of worth or beauty from
      the past seems even more attractive. Practically anything Vintage sounds
      more interesting. There is a story there, a history and context to the
      past of an object. “So why buy vintage? Often the impetus is fueled by the
      excitement of the hunt. It is easy to find current pieces in your local
      mall or online site, but shopping for vintage is an unparalleled treasure
      hunt.” -Jennifer Baumgartner Psy.D., remarked in a Psychology Today
      article titled “The Psychology of Vintage”.


      Vintage watches, by some estimates, have become a $3 billion market with
      the value of some watches soaring in recent years. “I remember in 1990 a
      dealer came in with hundreds of &shy;Daytonas, the good ones from the
      ’60s,” says Daryn Schnipper, chairman of &shy;Sotheby’s international
      watch division, “At the time they were worth $800. There was no market.
      Now they’ve gone through the roof.” &nbsp;Eric Ku, a Berkeley-based
      vintage watch dealer adds, “Collectors have gotten tired of wearing the
      same thing everybody else has,” and says, “New watches have become so
      expensive, and prices continue to go up each year, while spending the same
      money on vintage has proven itself in terms of the resale market, and when
      it comes to value, it can be a more sound decision.”

      **The Value of Waiting for IT &nbsp;**


      If the perceived value is high enough, people will wait for it. Yearning
      is a powerful human experience that has been masterfully manipulated by
      some of the most successful brands in history. One obvious and notable
      example is the Birkin or Kelly bag by Hermes - now nearly impossible for
      the average consumer to even get their hands on one, but if you do, it’s
      6-12 month wait for yours to arrive. For anything bespoke or custom made
      (clothes, furniture, jewelry) you will need to wait and it makes the
      eventual ownership that much more special. Anything that is of worth is
      worth waiting for.&nbsp; &nbsp;


      The formula (desire + waiting = demand) comes into contest with the
      growing Omnichannel world of luxury goods and services. Who needs to wait
      for an object of desire when according to Bloomberg Business, “Only 40
      percent of high-end brands don’t sell via the Web”.&nbsp; One of the
      longest holdouts for creating an e-commerce platform is Chanel and they
      are currently set to make the change in 2017. To this point, Chanel
      justified its decision to remain offline by maintaining that the in-store
      customer experience is of critical importance to the brand and customer
      experience. But for many consumers, e-commerce is beyond the norm and is
      often the preferred path to purchase. With millennials representing more
      than 25% of the US population and representing upward of $200 billion
      annually in buying power, they hold increasing influence over retailers
      and luxury brands. Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s President of Fashion said
      about opening up sales for the brand online recently in an interview,
      “It’s not so much a shift. It’s an evolution to better serve our
      customers. It’s more e-service than a pure e-commerce approach.”


      Chanel’s move is bound to impact the rest of the luxury fashion world.
      While the price point will remain the same, strengthening the label’s air
      of exclusivity, the items will arguably be far more accessible than ever
      before to an even wider audience. For a brand that’s held onto its luxury
      status without catering to the masses, this switch in business practice
      raises concerns that e-commerce will ultimately diminish the label. The
      shift also insures a larger growth in revenue as reports have shown that
      online sales in the world of luxury fashion are growing two times as fast
      as the market itself. In an age when half of luxury shoppers are already
      shopping and purchasing online, opening up an e-commerce platform seems
      like a logical business strategy. How it may affect Chanel as a luxury
      brand however, is not so easy to predict.&nbsp;

      **Slowing Aging and Living Longer**


      It’s curious that society values consumable goods that have aged and
      improved over time but when it comes to our appearance, Time is definitely
      more foe than friend. Anti-aging products at every price range (mass to
      luxury) promise to slow or halt the march of time across our face and
      body. Halting the appearance of aging from head to toe has been the
      general practice of those with means for decades now and the cosmetic
      surgery industry has never been healthier - topping out at just over 8
      billion in 2016. Even the best surgeons around the globe can only alter
      and affect the appearance of aging. The big prize for making a dent in
      living longer falls into the hands of genetics and bioscience.&nbsp;


      The hunt for unlocking the secrets to aging and assisting us in our desire
      for longevity seems to be found by the decoding of our DNA. Human DNA is a
      genome composed of 23 pairs of chromosomes, which breaks down into six
      billion pieces that all come together to give each person their unique
      characteristics and properties. While we have the ability to sequence
      important parts of the genome, the ability to know the entire sequence has
      the potential to make huge strides in the area of understanding and
      predicting disease, and more importantly, to personalize medicine.


      Craig Venter, one of the first people to map the human genome, offers an
      executive physical at his latest venture, the La Jolla, California based
      Human Longevity, Inc. For $25,000, the company will sequence your DNA and
      run a full complement of tests to determine your risk for heart disease,
      melanoma, dementia, and other ailments. “Having the ability to control
      health and life outcomes is the ultimate luxury,” he says. To “buy” more
      precious time and extending life through a deeper understanding of how we
      can chart a personal path to better health is no doubt a prize most
      coveted.&nbsp;
