      Lucia Litman a food photographer and stylist based out of San Francisco
      who's inspired by the natural beauty and colors of food. When she's not
      visiting farmers markets searching for colorful produce, you can find her
      at home listening and dancing to Drake or coming up with justifications to
      buy another pair of 6 inch heels.

      **Orit:** Your weekly #Pantoneposts first grabbed my eye. What motivated
      you to look at pms chips the way you do?

      **Lucia:**&nbsp;It was actually the food that inspired me and led me to use
      the pantone chips! After a long day at the office, I bought a box of fruit
      loops (my guilty comfort food pleasure!) and poured myself a bowl to enjoy
      - but ended up falling asleep before I could enjoy them. I woke up and
      looked at the bright colors in my cereal bowl and grabbed a nearby set of
      Pantone chips I had from a previous project, and started to arrange them by
      color! It really started as an accident during a very busy time in my life,
      and became almost a meditative and relaxing process for me!

      **Orit:** As a food stylist, how would you say luxury has navigated your
      approach when conceptualizing your set.

      **Lucia:**&nbsp;Living in California, I'm awarded many luxuries - year
      round I get access to the best and tastiest avocados and juiciest fruit
      around. I think access to fresh food, especially produce, is a luxury that
      I'm especially grateful for. If I lived somewhere that didn't have access
      to this amazing food, I definitely wouldn't be able to do this project!

      **Orit:** What inspires you?

      **Lucia:**&nbsp;For my Pantone project, food and nature really inspire me.
      The colors of the food that nature produces continue to amaze me! I'm still
      new to California, so I like to check out new neighborhoods and towns and
      always visit the local grocery stores or farmers markets, so I have to
      think that the state itself is a source of inspiration!

      **Q:** Now that you have relocated to California, what's next for
      you?&nbsp;

      **Lucia:**&nbsp;Right now, I'm hoping to continue to explore the amazing
      produce that California has to offer. I'd also love to play with Pantone
      colors and how they can be represented through my outfits and fashion.
      I love clothes, but don't often show my outfits or style on my Instagram,
      and that's something I hope to do more of soon!​
