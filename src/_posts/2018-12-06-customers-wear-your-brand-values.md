  "Marketers should understand that an entire generation of enlightened
  consumers operates with a philosophy that every brand they use, wear and
  consume reflects on their own personal brand.”

  This past week Italian fashion brand Dolce and Gabbana found themselves facing
  with yet another public relations and branding blunder by releasing a series
  of social media videos featuring a Chinese woman attempting to use chopsticks
  to eat 4 different types of Italian food titled “The Great Show”.<br>The
  overall effect was culturally insensitive at best and for many Chinese,
  blatantly racist.

      One of the local models who backed out of the upcoming D&G show in China
      posted on social media after the brand came out with an apology (which
      somehow never used the word “sorry”) saying “ Be sure that from now on, no
      one from China (and probably the whole world” will ever purchase anything
      from your brand. Sucks right? You thought you would make money by coming
      to China and by holding a show while being so disrespectful and racist?
      You got it all wrong because we aren’t dumb when you say you love China.
      you don’t love China, you love money. China is rich yes but China is rich
      in its values, its culture and its people and they won’t spend a penny on
      a brand that does not respect that.” *Ouch.*

      Dolce and Gabbana have a history of making insensitive statements and
      actions. In 2015 they released a shoe that was named the “Slave Sandal”
      and in 2016 they offended the global LGBTQ community by stating that “The
      only family is the traditional one. No chemical offspring and
      rented<br>uterus,” claiming that “synthetic children” are created from
      “semen chosen from a catalog.” These statements prompted a backlash by
      many including Sir Elton John who wrote: “How dare you refer to my
      beautiful children as ’synthetic and shame on you for wagging your
      judgmental little fingers at IVF—a miracle that has allowed legions of
      loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfill their dream of having
      children…. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again.” Gabbana
      lashed out with a series of tweets labeling the singer a “fascist” and
      calling on people to #BoycottEltonJohn.

      Today, the best brands stand for a set of beliefs - a set of transparent
      values that align with their intended audience. If these values are not
      clearly understood and internalized by customers the only way to interpret
      what a brand stands for is by tracking how it preforms and communicates
      across the available touchpoints (social media, advertising, in-store, web
      sites, etc.). It’s possible that Dolce and Gabbana has a set of beliefs
      but when the brand (especially the CEO) does not keep to those beliefs -
      you get a crisis that can have lasting or permanent damage to the
      reputation and credibility for a brand.

      Joakim Lundquist, CEO / Founder of Lundquist, a corporate Communications
      firm in Milan said about the issue: “The Dolce Gabbana crisis should be
      seen as a wakeup call for companies in the fashion industry. Scandals like
      this confirm our research findings that fashion and luxury companies can
      no longer afford to ignore stakeholder expectations for transparency,
      openness, accountability and dialogue.”

      Brands should understand that an entire generation of enlightened
      consumers operate with a philosophy that every brand they use, wear and
      consume reflects on their own personal brand. This connection can have
      either a positive or negative impact based on how brands preform - every
      day and on every platform.

      Though most have turned away from them, perhaps Dolce and Gabbana can find
      a new audience. Given the rise of intolerance and bigotry found around the
      world today, there just may be a new crowd of narrow minded individuals
      that want to support a brand that thinks and acts the way they do.
      Unfortunately we live in a world where racism has not gone out of fashion.
