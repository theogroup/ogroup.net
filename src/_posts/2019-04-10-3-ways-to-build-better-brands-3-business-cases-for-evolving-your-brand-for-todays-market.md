  “What exactly is a brand and why does branding matter?” Even though very few
  of our clients explicitly ask this question, many of them ask themselves
  questions like this one at some point when investigating their marketing or
  branding efforts (or perhaps justifying budgets for these efforts). For many
  businesses we work with, it’s pretty common for them not to be exactly sure
  why branding matters, why their customers would care about it or how better
  brand development could help differentiate in a competitive marketplace.
  &nbsp;Most know some-thing is not right with their messaging, image or
  presentation but we often need to be educated on the value of how good
  branding helps with all those challenges and more. Over the past few years we
  have used the following three examples of how strategic brand building can
  have a direct impact on business value, customer relevancy and loyalty.
  &nbsp;These are not the only examples of how a smart branding can impact a
  businesses bottom line, but these examples are especially relevant for a
  modern audience who is hyper-aware of brand messaging and behavior. We have
  framed these examples as action statements - a direct challenge to anyone
  needing their brand to work harder for their business and stand for clear set
  of identifiable differentiators for current and potential customers. &nbsp;

      1. Define Your Brand Promise and Create Business Advantages Challenge:
      Evolve a set of Product Benefits into a compelling Brand Promise Benefit:
      &nbsp;Increase Business Value and Gain Competitive Footing


      Belonging, Status, Allure, Control, Health, Security, Creativity, Respect,
      Delight or Power are just some of the personal emotional drivers that are
      behind the buying decisions of most people. The are also sophisticated
      promises that smart brands use to attract potential buyers - an unspoken
      and compelling value that is often more powerful than a product itself.
      Products and services can be copied and replaced but brands that have a
      unique promise (that quintes-sential value beyond the surface) can
      leverage their point of difference to command ownable whitespace, craft a
      unique value proposition and attract the ideal customer again and again..
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A good example of a clear brand promise impacting
      business values is the recent acquisition of Casamigos tequila (owned in
      part by George Clooney) to Diageo. Apart from the impressive products’
      sales figures since launching in 2013 and the excellent quality of the
      product itself was the brand really worth $1Billion price tag? &nbsp;To
      the spirit industry experts that penned the deal, Mr. Clooney’s attachment
      transformed an excellent product into a powerful brand that resulted in a
      record-breaking acquisition. &nbsp;As a brand ambassador with
      international recognition, Mr. Clooney reinforces the aspirational brand
      promise of Casamigos and helps to communicate a brand that represents
      Success, Allure and Respect to potential and existing consumers around the
      world. Understandably, not many business can easily attach themselves to
      an international celebrity to create instant brand value, but every
      business can adapt a clear brand promise - a experiential value that ads
      benefit for a consumer beyond a well conceived product or exceptional
      service. Look at Apple (Delight), BMW (Status), Cartier (Love) and Whole
      Foods (Wholesomeness) as examples of brands who have successfully tapped
      into the emotional power of a brand promise to drive price beyond market
      value and continue to attract and keep loyal customers.

      2. Claim Your Brand Values to Attract and Keep Customers Challenge: Brands
      Need to Embody and Reflect a Set of Authentic Values Benefit: Build
      Customer Trust and Loyalty and Awareness


      Do you know and use your brand’s set of values to connect with customers?
      If not, generations of consumers will happily move past you and find a
      brand that has values similar to their own. Emerging generations have
      considerable spending power and demand more from brands today. 73% of
      millennials and 72% of Gen Z are willing to pay extra for products and
      services from companies dedicated to social and environmental change,
      compared to just 51 percent of boomers. On top of that, 70% of Gen Z would
      actively engage with a brand that could help them make a difference. Brand
      values don’t have to associat-ed with sustainability or social causes but
      they do need to be relatable and compelling to the audience you are
      wanting to engage with. REI is great example of a compelling brand that
      stands by their values (Recreation, Outdoors, Community). &nbsp;Their
      #OptOutside program challenges the retail institution’s Black Friday event
      by paying their 12,000+ employees to take time off on that day to be with
      their family and friends. When #OptOutside started it was about reclaiming
      a day to give thanks and re-grounding with what the brand value most in
      life as a community. Today, millions of people have chosen to make a walk
      in the park part of their family tradition instead of shopping indoors.
      “Since launching #OptOutside, we’ve watched more than 200 retailers go out
      of business. &nbsp;It has been a period of enormous change in retail.
      We’ve stayed healthy partly because we’ve stuck with our core values —
      like giving our employees time to do what they love with the people they
      love during the holidays. It’s enabled us to connect millions of people
      with the outdoors.” REI CEO Jerry Stritzk REI is not alone in their
      ability to clarify and stand by a set of brand values - The New York Times
      (Truth), Nike (Human Potential), American Express (Integri-ty), Starbucks
      (Community) and Adobe (Creativity) are all good examples of brands that
      have meaningful, actionable, clear and timeless values.&nbsp;

      3. Help Consumers build their Personal Brands to maintain Relevancy
      Challenge: The new Transformation Economy asks more from brands Benefit:
      Establish Relevancy and Deeper Connection to Consumers


      Consumers today are starting to seek and demand transformative products
      and services - not settling for &nbsp;“lesser” experiences. These
      “seeking” consum-ers are savvy, selective and informed, and want to be
      understood on a deeper level by the brands they choose to embrace. Enter
      the Transformational Economy where consumers are seeking more than mere
      experience and where they have become their own authority, expert and
      agents of change. The products and services they consume turn into
      vehicles for supporting their own personal brand which is in a constant
      state of becoming. Brands that can offer these consumers a more meaningful
      route to their individual achievements will be ahead of the game and
      forming meaningful and lasting relation-ships with their customers, not
      just speaking with them. One brand that was born to take advantage of the
      Transformational Economy is fitness lifestyle brand Peloton. The
      6-year-old company’s business model is based on digital content and a
      growing rider community—1 million at last count (celebs like Michael
      Phelps and Neil Patrick Harris are fans)—connected through Wi-Fi and
      social media that does the heavy brand lifting. One of the most talked
      about startups, Peloton has gone through five funding rounds, most
      recently tallying $325 million and, with its recent $1.25 billion
      valuation, Peloton is now officially a unicorn. At the heart of every
      brand touchpoint, Peleton enables their customers to succeed on their own
      terms, from the comfort of their own homes and connected to a community of
      like-minded trans-formational enthusiasts.&nbsp;


      Brands like Peloton understand the consumers today who are looking for
      products or services to provide transformational opportunities
      and&nbsp;<br>will pay a premium for that possibility. &nbsp;A
      transformational experience is differentiated from the conventional and
      valued higher even than&nbsp;<br>a traditional experience. &nbsp;
