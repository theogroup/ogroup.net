      Re-envisioning elements such as positioning, concept, mood, identity,
      graphic assets and the rest – "resolving them" in a manner of speaking
      – delivers a real sense of satisfaction.





      I have seen brands approach rebranding in every conceivable way and with
      varying degrees of success. That is because even the best agencies and
      clients cannot overcome the negative pull of poor planning. I have now been
      able to identify five areas that upscale brands must concentrate on to
      successfully rebuild. They include:





      • Establishing strong positioning

      <br>• Knowing the target

      <br>• Staffing properly

      <br>• Creating a straightforward approval process

      <br>• Preparing for launch





      **ESTABLISHING STRONG POSITIONING**





      A concrete definition of "luxury" is, at best, illusive. It is safe to say
      that to be well positioned in the luxury category, a brand's offering must
      be connectable in some way to the idea of being truly exceptional. If the
      offering does not make sense in the luxury category, take a second look.
      Ill-conceived luxury items such as Frisbees and Instant Noodles –which both
      exist – Google them – might have done well to look to other categories and
      models early on in their development.





      **Luxury is not just about premium price.**





      Maintaining the proper perception of a brand associated with high-end goods
      or services requires careful consideration and steadfast dedication from
      beginning to end – and never giving in to tempting but inappropriate
      opportunities for sponsorship and product placement. Part of creating
      a strong position for a luxury brand is aligning your benchmarks, goals and
      objectives with key performance indicators (KPIs).





      **KNOWING THE TARGET**





      Be as specific as possible about the consumer—not just demographics. In
      fact, psychographics tend to be more helpful in the early stages of brand
      development. By zeroing in on the "Who?" you are acknowledging that the
      brand under development is for a specific group of people to become a part
      of. A luxury brand cannot be everything to everyone, and luxury brands need
      to be able to constantly anticipate or even create the wants and needs of
      their devotees.





      **STAFFING PROPERLY**





      It is crucial for luxury brands to have the right personnel in place.
      Branding, especially rebranding, is a very involved process – as it should
      be. In most cases, there should be one point-person on the client's side
      who heads up the project. This will take significant time and energy and
      cannot be an afterthought – it is an important role. That person must be
      able to weigh and balance the internal interactions with stakeholders and
      the client/agency relationship. The goal is to keep things on-track, secure
      the proper approvals in a timely manner, and avoid design-by-committee
      direction at all costs.





      If this is the first time your business is considering a rebrand, the roles
      that need to be staffed, both during and after the process, might require
      some additional consideration. For example, a brand without a chief
      marketing officer will need to take a close look at who is going to
      spearhead the project, or else everyone's best efforts might be wasted. In
      another example, shifting focus to e-commerce would require the creation of
      jobs and allocation of resources that were covered by others in the past.
      E-commerce Web sites require as many, if not more, resources as opening
      a bricks-and-mortar store.





      Without the proper people, roles go unfilled and projects stall, fail or
      die. When the right people are in place and are aligned, you have set your
      rebrand up for success.





      **CREATING A STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROVAL PROCESS**





      Sometimes clients think that keeping the boss out of discussions in the
      early stages will make things move more quickly down the line. It rarely
      does.​

      One step forward, two steps back almost never leads to top-notch results.
      Usually characterized as the "wildly unpredictable owner/boss," the real
      issue is that this key stakeholder be looped in early on to understand the
      context that leads to various decisions. Checking in with
      ownership/management at the beginning and at project milestones allows the
      boss to be involved without having to micromanage the day-to-day progress
      of the branding initiative.





      On the flip side, the ability to receive timely feedback, along with
      approvals and commitments, is key to project workflow and successfully
      completing the work.





      **PREPARING FOR LAUNCH**





      No specific budget and insufficient or open-ended timing usually spells
      doom for a luxury brand looking to reinvent itself.





      If a brand has not allocated a specific budget or considered a realistic
      timeline, the greatest idea ever might never see the light of day – or
      worse, emerge half-baked when it does. The planning or launch strategy
      stage is often looked at as expendable, when it is actually make-or-break
      to getting your project off the ground. Determine what budgets exist to
      undertake rebranding work, and consider realistic timelines required to
      bring that work to life.





      **REBRANDING IS challenging.**





      Well-calculated and well-executed changes are crucial to positive luxury
      brand perception.
