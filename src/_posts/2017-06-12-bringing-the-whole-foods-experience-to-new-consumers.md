      Whole Foods has begun introducing their new 365 by Whole Foods Market
      stores, with the first location opening just last week in Silver Lake,
      California. The markets are designed to expand Whole Foods’ appeal by
      offering lower prices while also infusing more technology into the shopping
      experience.

      The way the world perceives premium and luxury goods and services has
      changed drastically, providing the perfect opportunity for this launch. We
      are firm believers that price does not necessarily correlate with premium
      or luxury any longer. Lower-priced goods and services can absolutely be
      considered luxury, especially when the experience exceeds expectations or
      improves consumers’ perceptions about a brand. At The O Group, Rethink
      Luxury is the point of view that drives all of our work. It’s our ethos for
      shifting how consumers view both luxury and traditionally non-luxury
      brands. So you can imagine how excited we were when Whole Foods announced
      "365."​

      You could argue that Whole Foods is not a luxury brand. Sure, they offer
      premium-priced food and other goods, but at its core the brand is just
      a grocery store, right? Wrong.

      Whole Foods has helped create a monumental shift in how consumers approach
      shopping for groceries. From encouraging consumers to understand where
      their food comes from, to providing access to obscure and hard-to-find
      produce to their local market, the chain has elevated the grocery shopping
      experience to something for which people are willing to pay a premium.

      So, should we consider a scaled-down and lower-priced version of Whole
      Foods to be luxury? Definitely. Here’s why: regardless of the cost of the
      goods found at the new 365 Markets, the brand provides shoppers an elevated
      and considered grocery shopping experience. There will be craft beer and
      coffee bars, in-store dining options and plenty of interesting new
      technology – including robots.

      Best of all for their Millennial target, the prices will be reasonable.
      After all, living well (even on a budget) is the greatest luxury of all.
