  Each morning you either drink a cup of coffee or a smoothie, look at your day
  ahead and emails, check the weather and then decide what to wear. We probably
  all have some kind of similar routine for getting ready, whether it's choosing
  your outfit or picking the right accessories.​

      That's because how you present yourself and what you wear depends on what
      you've got planned that day. What are you doing? Who will you see? The
      alternative: jumping out of bed and wearing "whatever" might be okay, but
      isn't likely to set you up for success and make the right (i.e. killer)
      impression.​

      **First Things First**


      Lately, we've had the same conversation multiple times with a number of
      highly motivated, visionary and successful entrepreneurs launching new
      Luxury brands. In each case, they've described how significant time and
      money have been put toward creating elements like logos, graphics and
      packaging design comps prior to conceptual brand development, and in some
      cases, even before the product itself exists.


      We get it. In fact, to a degree, we applaud it. Having worked with dozens
      of entrepreneurs over the last 30 years, we know that they're passionate
      about their ideas and live for the opportunity to share them with the
      world. They want everything to happen fast. The temptation to come up with
      names, logos, packaging and other elements is too strong to ignore. After
      all, that's building the brand right? Yes it is, but it's also too soon.
      As Gary Vaynerchuk, founder of Wine Library TV and VaynerMedia wrote in
      his book, Crush It, "Patience is the secret sauce."


      The ‘Design First' approach might work in some mass categories, where
      products and services are more commoditized and value-focused (and catchy
      names and packages may be the only real differentiators). But in the
      Luxury space, it's all about cultivating a highly considered and cohesive
      brand experience. Even the slightest misalignment between the branding and
      the offering will be detected by discerning Luxury consumers. They'll move
      on to the Luxury brands who get it right faster than you can spell BMW.


      **So, What Do You Think?**


      Our agency is often asked to assess Design work commissioned before the
      concept, and sometimes the product, has been developed. Trust us, there's
      no shortage of personal opinions at creative agencies, but how can designs
      be accurately evaluated if target audience, specific goals, positioning
      and the like haven't been established? The unfortunate answer is: they
      can't. So while sometimes they'll be appropriate, many times they won't.
      And that means the work needs to be done again. More time. More money. Not
      good.


      When you pick the wrong clothes without the proper due diligence, you may
      end up without your favorite power tie for the important meeting or
      drenched and freezing on a rainy day. When brands execute Design before
      completing the conceptual work, they inhibit their ability to fully
      realize their potential. Not exactly the best way to launch.


      **Understand The Differance Between Branding And Design**


      It's important to develop a Luxury brand step-by-step in the proper order.
      Start at the beginning. The thinking around category, target
      audience/consumer, unique differentiators, and of course, the actual
      offerings must be developed before deciding on the brand's look and feel.
      In many cases, even the name should be decided upon later rather than
      sooner. Who's the target? What do they respond to? Who else competes in
      the space? What are they about?​

      Branding is the sum total effect of Positioning, Concept, Design and
      Execution.

      It's the world's perception of a company and it's offering. Design (the
      look, feel and voice) is only one part of the brand and it shouldn't be
      the first consideration.


      **No More TA-DA Moments**


      Branding, when done properly, is a slow and steady build toward the
      alignment, cohesion and consistency of all brand touch points. Working
      with conceptual thinkers, avoiding the urge to move straight to visuals,
      and making sure that the brand is built for its target will keep a Luxury
      brand focused on developing the foundational thinking crucial to
      successful Design execution and brand launch. The "Wow!" you'll get for a
      flashy logo and package will wear off much sooner than the satisfaction
      you'll experience after bringing an amazing idea to life.​
