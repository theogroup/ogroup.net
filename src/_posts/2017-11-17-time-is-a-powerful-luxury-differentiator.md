  **Part 2:&nbsp; The Luxury of Moving Ahead of Time**


  *By Daymon Bruck*


  &nbsp;


  **Bypassing “Normal” Time &nbsp;**​


  I remember taking a flight from NYC to Paris on the Air France Concord in the
  mid 90’s and when I got into the plane for the first time I thought – what's
  so special about this? A tight and slightly claustrophobic cabin (by jumbo-jet
  standards) was just aquatically appointed and left me disappointed: I was
  expecting more after all the hype and prestige associated with the Concord
  brand. What did impress me (and my colleagues at the time) was the super fresh
  Parisian baked goods I brought back with me to the office at 9:00 am for
  breakfast, only 3.5 hours from taking off from France the same day. Those same
  pastries would have been day-old stale had they arrived by any other means
  available at the time. Reducing the hours spent in transit between
  destinations by any measure and making the most of your time on either side is
  still a luxury high on everyone’s list. Removing the barriers of time through
  speed, privilege or technology (VIP access, private jets, exclusive travel
  connections, etc.) and other types of rarefied access that allow for “jumping
  the line” provides the greatest luxury for those that put the highest value on
  their personal and professional time. Those five minutes you spend waiting in
  line (any line) will never be reclaimed. With less and less time and people
  putting more value on how they spend personal time, how will brands create
  experience worth our limited time? Bottom line - it better be amazing. As
  brand builders, we have been increasingly asking ourselves and our clients -
  what barriers, inconveniences or steps that create a personal time suck could
  be removed to provide a luxury experience that bypasses the normal or common
  flow of time?&nbsp;

      **Faster Than the Rest &nbsp;**


      Technology has obviously helped with the process of removing “normal”
      barriers of time. Starbucks with their Mobile Order & Pay allows you to
      place your order and pay ahead on the smartphone Starbucks app - walk into
      the store and without waiting in line, pick up your order and off you go.
      Many movie theaters are taking steps to minimize moviegoers’ time finding
      seats and parking spaces in order to maximize the movie going experience
      by offering reserved seating online ahead of time.&nbsp;


      The fashion industry has responded to the need for moving faster than
      normal and historic means by embracing the new “see-now-buy-now” approach
      that allows for customers to order items right off the runway. Brands like
      Tom Ford, Burberry, Diane von Furstenberg, and several others have
      launched these programs. In a recent press release Ford said, “In a world
      that has become increasingly immediate, the current way of showing a
      collection four months before it is available to customers is an
      antiquated idea and one that no longer makes sense. Our customers today
      want a collection that is immediately available.” New technology, market
      trends, and changing social attitudes have brands catering to customer
      demands in an unprecedented manner. Today you can acquire nearly any item
      like a vintage Rolex watch from MrPorter.com the same day or order any
      service like a private jet charter with the swipe of a finger, and have
      practically anything you desire customized to your preferences.

      **Hyper Speed Customer Service &nbsp;**


      After the hype of Pokemon Go! in 2016, Augmented Reality (AR) as a concept
      and industry has become more approachable and the applications are growing
      daily. The AR user base is rapidly growing, and the projected industry
      growth is predicted to reach $117.4 billion by 2022, as indicated by
      Markets and Markets research. It’s not surprising that furniture,
      clothing, and makeup tools are among the most popular cases to experiment
      with AR, as these categories are what various social groups are interested
      in. Several global brands (Tissot, Hugo Boss, BMW, Conde Nast) have
      already implemented AR into their campaigns or services and proved that it
      works. Why is it worth investing in? Because AR offers an enhanced and
      highly engaging “try-and-buy” solution: simple, quick, interactive and
      ultra-convenient. &nbsp;


      Launching a new non-tech customer service solution, Nordstrom is opening a
      location in Los Angeles called Nordstrom Local. The only 3,000 square-foot
      footprint store is designed as a neighborhood hub that allows people to
      shop and access Nordstrom services, but won’t actually stock inventory. As
      retailers are struggling to adjust to changing shopping habits, fighting
      to balance online and in-store sales as store traffic declines, more and
      more retailers are looking for new models to engage customers. The store
      will offer services like manicures, as well as wine, beer, coffee or juice
      from an in-store bar in the hopes of turning a trip to Nordstrom into an
      outing. “We know there are more and more demands on a customer’s time and
      we wanted to offer our best services in a convenient location to meet
      their shopping needs,” Shea Jensen, Nordstrom senior vice president of
      customer experience, said in a statement. For convenience, customers will
      also have access to convenient services including Buy Online, In-Store
      pickup, Curbside pickup, alterations and tailoring.

      **Feeding the Desire to Be First &nbsp;**


      Being first is the preoccupation of over achievers and A Types around the
      world. The appeal is understandable; there is only one “first” and
      everything after this is, well, not first. No matter how one achieves
      becoming first, the cachet, prestige, bragging rights and a general sense
      of superiority are inherent to the title. Being first can also have a
      price tag attached to it because you are likely to bypass “normal”
      channels of waiting if you can afford to do so. Why wait in line if you
      can afford to pay to get in ahead of everyone else? First class airline
      passengers depart the plane first, VIP access to many events allow you to
      skip the line entirely and if you are a large donor to an arts or cultural
      institution you will often be the first to see a new exhibit or
      performance.&nbsp;


      One experience that many people are already lining up for is the prize to
      be amongst the first tourists to space. According to Virgin Galactic,
      80,000 people have already put their names down on the waiting list for a
      spot on their spaceships and be among the first to experience traveling to
      space. The first 100 passengers paid the full price deposit of $250,000,
      while others on the waiting list paid smaller deposits. These deposits
      have already amounted to $30 million in funding for the design of the
      spacecraft. Virgin Galactic’s competitor, SpaceX has announced this year
      that two private citizens will be taking a trip around the moon in 2018.
      The tourists, who have not been named, have already paid a significant
      deposit, also not disclosed by the company. Whatever the sum, being the
      first humans to go back to the moon since 1972 is a luxury that has value
      well beyond the hefty price tag. &nbsp;

      **Luxury + Time = Innovation&nbsp;**


      In the 2017 State of the Luxury Industry Report produced by Luxury Daily
      with over 600 industry insiders surveyed identified the need for
      innovation as a critical business priority for 2017. Because of the
      rapidly changing consumer marketplace and how the very idea of “luxury” is
      evolving, there is an industry consensus that innovating with new
      products, new services, new marketing strategies and new ways to engage
      with the affluent customers is key. What’s less clear from the survey and
      from the report in general is how luxury brands will execute and innovate
      against that need.


      We are of the opinion that all brands can innovate and differentiate by
      developing new ways for customers to save, use or increase the control of
      their personal time. Examples of this, offering customers to be first to
      an experience or first to access a new product or service, giving them
      ways to make the most of their time and even customizing brand
      interactions to improve customer service and increase the value of the
      time they spend. Until we have the ability to travel though time, we only
      have the precious minutes left to us and in the end, there can be no
      greater luxury than that.&nbsp;
