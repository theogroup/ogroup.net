      "Betty Boop is cheeky and fun, while Popeye is charismatic and larger than
      life," said Elizabeth Weinstein, client services manager at The O Group.
      "The bottle design stays true to it’s existing form, while playing up the
      brand’s favorite visual themes—the mariner-striped motif and cone-shaped
      bra.

      "By tapping these two iconic cartoon characters, and juxtaposing them in
      modern-day situations, you get a renewed sense of the brand’s personality.
      Jean Paul Gaultier has long been known for his rebellious, spirited
      attitude and designs. This collaboration plays into the fantastical, fun
      nature of the brand by modeling Le Male and Classique in Gaultier-inspired
      outfits."
