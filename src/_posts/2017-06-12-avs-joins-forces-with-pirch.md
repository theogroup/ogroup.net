      Pirch SoHo represents a fusion of fashion, home and technology. This new
      SoHo retail concept on the corner of Broome & Lafayette is a true
      interactive home shopping experience. In the beautiful 3-story downtown
      location, you can turn on the faucets, cook a meal and even take a bath in
      one of their private bathing suites, should you be so inclined.

      Our client, AVS (Audio Video Systems), specializes in the integration of
      all custom systems and control technologies throughout the home, and the
      kitchen is no exception. You can find AVS at the epicenter of this new
      Pirch space as a featured partner in the Connected Loft, a smart kitchen,
      where they feature best in class media, speakers, lighting, and control
      systems. This kitchen of the future, "shows the promise of tomorrow as our
      appliances learn to communicate with our food."​
