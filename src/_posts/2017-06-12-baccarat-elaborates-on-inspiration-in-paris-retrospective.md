      "From a continuity perspective, this exhibition makes sense for the
      brand…Baccarat has a history of purposeful and event driven presentations.

      <br>While this will surely appeal to brand loyalists, the museum exhibit
      provides an opportunity to reach a wider target: those who appreciate the
      luxury qualities of history and craftsmanship, as Baccarat has decorated
      the halls and tables of royal families for over 200 years. It’s also a…tool
      for the brand to artfully remind younger or unaware consumers of their
      relevance."
