The majority of opinions reflected the theme of retail having fallen behind the consumer behavior curve. Do you feel that’s true?​'

      **GREG FURMAN**: In my opinion, there are a few major consumer behavior
      trends driving the coming evolution of retail.

















      **"Brand" is no longer everything.**

















      It’s simply the price of admission. People are more cynical of traditional
      advertising, and from the moment they walk in the retail door they expect
      quintessential service. So traditional brand loyalty is challenged as never
      before.

















      **Experience Versus Stuff.**

















      The Boomers, a category of 80 million, are spending more now on special
      experiences than on things. Experiences and the memory of unique experience
      shared with family and friends are more valuable than possessions.

















      **Small Luxury Brands Gaining Traction.**

















      The Traub Group has done an interesting survey called "The New Davids."
      Given the fluidity of the web, word-of-mouth of loyal customers and the
      ability to inspire brand ambassadors, allows smaller luxury brands to grow
      revenue without massive investment in advertising. Enabled by the web,
      these small luxury craftsmen and artisans can now hold their own with
      international brands and are nibbling away at the big brands’ market share.
      They can rival the quality and design of the bigger luxury brands. The
      bigger luxury brands are just beginning to see this phenomenon as a serious
      threat.

















      **The Rise of Global.**

















      Consider the emerging communities of Africa, India, China and South
      America, each of which have populations of more than a billion. As their
      quality of life, achievement and wealth accelerates, there will be more
      people liberated to global tourism and spending on luxury products and
      services. The US and Europe will still be main attractions in that regard,
      this represents a major opportunity for luxury brands.

















      **ORIT**: I think Tom Schoenwaelder (Chief Commercial Officer at Doblin,
      the innovation and design arm of Deloitte) shared an opinion in the WWD
      article which really gets at the core of this conversation, including the
      specific consumer trends Greg pointed out above:

















      "The retail industry has a propensity to jump on bugaboo bandwagons or
      issues, like building innovation labs, and lose sight of the bigger
      picture."​

      It comes down to the fact that brands who keep the consumer as the focus of
      their growth and operations will come out on top. It’s critical to know
      your consumer inside and out. And I don’t just mean demographics. I mean to
      really understand their hearts and minds. What makes them tick. Where and
      how they spend their money outside of your brand, and perhaps more
      importantly, how they choose to spend their most valuable resource: time.

















      Crafting a product and experience that’s expertly tailored to the
      psychographic of your target audience will be key to positioning businesses
      for future growth and evolving alongside changing consumer behavior no
      matter the economy’s ups and downs.​
