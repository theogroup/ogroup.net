intro_markdown: 'The combined Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) markets are projected to generate around $150 billion dollars a year by 2020, according to a forecast by Digi-Capital. How can brands make the most of this opportunity?​'

      The projected market size represents a massive increase over the current
      combined revenue of AR and VR (around $4 billion) which is currently driven
      by the likes of brands like Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard and Samsung’s VR
      Gear.

















      Though AR and VR are terms that have been bandied about for some time, for
      the sake of this article I’ll include a quick summary of what
      differentiates the two technologies. Both AR and VR rely on
      computer-generated images for their experiences, however what separates the
      two is the level of immersion. AR typically adds a layer of CGI to enhance
      the user’s existing surroundings, whereas VR relies on CGI to create an
      immersive reality that surrounds the user.

















      As more players enter the market and drive innovation, more consumers will
      be interested in incorporating these futuristic interfaces into daily life.
      For brands and marketers alike the opportunities to engage with consumers
      and tell a unique brand story are endless.​

With this approach shoppers can peruse products and experience the assortment, all from the confines of wherever the brand wants to set up shop.Take Audi’s recently announced update to their popular virtual showroom, for instance. Leveraging the technologies of Oculus and HTC, Audi car shoppers can now explore the entire vehicle range through a vividly detailed and immersive VR experience in which they can "build" and examine configurations of every Audi model in a range of environments.​'

      While virtual showrooms are not necessarily a groundbreaking move, the
      benefits can be substantial. For example, after one of Audi’s London
      dealerships transitioned to a "completely digital showroom" in which
      customers could digitally customize a potential vehicle, sales at that
      particular location increased by 70%. Audi, like other brands, has good
      cause to bank on VR’s potential.

















      For hospitality, tourism and real estate brands, showcasing properties and
      giving potential visitors a chance to virtually explore their surroundings
      prior to making an investment – whether in the form of a purchase, rental
      or trip taking a trip – is an appealing experience for consumers. A highly
      engaging VR tour could help guide consumers toward booking a trip, assuage
      any anxieties about a particular rental property location, and even help
      condo brands connect with the much sought-after (and
      technologically-driven) millennial consumer as they age into
      home-purchasing range.​

      But the conversation doesn’t begin and end with VR. Despite the public
      failing of Google’s Glass, Augmented Reality has been making its case for
      consumer adoption, and Microsoft’s Hololens is poised to take up the
      mantle. Rather than an always-on accessory, the Hololens is specifically
      designed to seamlessly integrate into users’ entertainment, creative output
      and connected home. Brands ranging from appliance and home theater
      manufacturers to furniture and bedding producers need to be ready to
      integrate into this new frontier of home-based AR.

















      VR and AR, which at one point seemed like a science-fiction pipe dream, are
      rapidly becoming mainstream and adopted by consumers from all walks of
      life. Brands must be ready to capitalize on this shift and use these
      platforms to connect with their consumers, lest they lose out to their
      competitors who are willing and able to innovate.​
