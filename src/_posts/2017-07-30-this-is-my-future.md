  30 years ago I walked away from corporate life as a group creative director to become an entrepreneur. Without looking back I rolled up my sleeves and got to work as an independent agency owner.&nbsp;

      It was a simple agency model where design ruled but inevitably questions
      were constantly asked to get to deeper and more effective solutions. Even
      then, it wasn’t just about the design…our work had to have
      a purpose.&nbsp;





      Time certainly flew by and my agency grew and grew. We became a robust and
      very passionate group of designers, strategists, producers and client
      services advocates. Our focus went from generalists to experts focused on
      luxury branding which proved a wise move especially in this ever-changing
      world. And work life continued to be good. No, not just good - great.

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>In 1993 The O Group hired our very first creative director Daymon Bruck
      and with his contributions the agency prospered and produced exceptional
      creative work. As a new entrepreneur, Daymon allowed me to “let go” of
      previous roles and realize my true strength was running a growing agency,
      building a unique culture, nourishing and guiding my staff, our partners
      and most importantly, the clients.

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>**We cared, we worked hard and we had big dreams.&nbsp;**

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>Amazing clients like Salvatore Ferragamo, Miramax, Mo&euml;t Hennessy
      USA, Lacoste to Harry Winston and so many more fueled us forward through
      the years. While the world kept changing, we kept evolving. “Disrupting”
      the status quo was important in our hearts and souls, and most importantly
      for our clients.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>**But then…something odd happened.**

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>Success doesn’t insure happiness, especially when your gut tells you
      something is out of place and not quite right. I knew something was not
      quite right. The traditional agency model was no longer serving me, and
      I had a feeling my clients sensed this too. As the agency grew, I started
      to become more and more removed from the work and day-to-day client
      interactions. I desperately needed to change it up because I was struggling
      to find the passion I once had for my work. I wanted to work better, work
      smarter and to forge true relationships with clients as I had so many times
      in the past 30 years.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>**I needed to make a pretty major change.&nbsp;**

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>I did not know what this new work model looked like, but one thing was
      for sure, I didn’t want to take on this new venture alone. 30 years without
      a partner was lonely and frustrating at times, so I reached out to someone
      that was a catalyst for change in my career many years ago, my first
      creative director - Daymon Bruck. After many years of East Coast based,
      large agency experience, he had moved back to Seattle to start his own
      branding agency. I shared with him my feelings about how the traditional
      agency model was “broken” and felt the need to evolve once again. He agreed
      and we began talking about the concept of a “deconstructed” agency. One
      where we are able to be adaptive and agile to the client’s changing needs.
      One where the value of working with seasoned experts who have a network of
      best in class experts/partners is exciting and adds value where it is
      needed. One where the client isn’t paying for an entire staff of people
      even if they aren’t working on their project. Best of all, one where we
      pick and choose the projects and clients that WE have a true passion and
      desire for. The excitement, the romance, the passion came flowing back into
      both of our veins. And a new agency model was born.&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>**East joins West.&nbsp;**

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>Everything old has become new again. Except bigger, better and even
      more delicious and amazing. We are headquartered in NYC but launched
      O Group West in Seattle. As we celebrate our 30th anniversary this year,
      I feel life has come full circle. We are taking the best of the past and
      moving that success forward to rethink not only luxury but also how to best
      serve our clients. Our reforged partnership and the birth of O Group West
      is the right disruption in the tradition of embracing change. We are
      seasoned professionals that have the passion and experience to make this
      model a success and it’s the only way we care to do business. &nbsp;&nbsp;

      <br>&nbsp;

      <br>So get ready friends. This is going to be an amazing time for our
      clients, our partners and us.&nbsp;
