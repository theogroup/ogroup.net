  Malls and mall branding are an ever-changing, multi-dimensional puzzle. Mall
  operators are constantly trying to attract consumers and tenants to their
  properties’ "next big things." Successful malls execute well but they could
  and should be even better​

      With retail rapidly evolving and consumers’ desire for experience
      mounting, malls are in a position to reach unprecedented levels of
      relevance. Malls can become important to people not only as places to
      spend their money and their time, but also as living brands that are
      important in facilitating or creating meaningful experiences. It’s clear
      that malls need to become much more than a collection of stores and the
      physical space that connects them. But what should they be? What could
      they be? There's more than one answer and that's why the topic of mall
      branding is so interesting. By thinking and acting like luxury brands,
      malls – luxury, premium or otherwise – could become hyper-relevant to
      consumers’ lives.


      **1. Concept is King:&nbsp;**Mall operators should push even harder to
      develop concept-driven mall brands, and to harness the power of luxury
      positioning, aesthetics and tactics. Mall brands built around an enhanced
      focus on lifestyle and pyschography will win out over older ideas like
      convenience or broad selection. Mass brands need to reach as many people
      as possible, so by design, they have to be diverse. So luxury mall brands
      should be conceived around more unified consumer interests. For example,
      an active lifestyle mall brand would be crafted and would behave in ways
      very different from a fashion-forward mall brand. This doesn’t limit the
      types of stores, but rather it focuses them around consumer mindset and
      interest allowing people to feel a deeper connection and allegiance with
      that property. It’s about replacing breadth with depth in a time when
      specialization is highly valued.


      **2. Keep Calm and Carry On:&nbsp;**Malls should create, design, launch
      and interact with strength, poise and confidence. Well-branded malls will
      be cognizant and in control of every touch point. After all, they know
      they’re only as strong as their weakest one. Only by executing and
      expressing their brands and missions to the world in compelling and
      evocative ways can mall brands truly be greater than the sum of their
      parts.​

      That could lead to amazingly diverse and unique approaches that draw
      attention season after season and finally enable the mall to be more than
      the sum of its parts.


      **3. Surround Yourself with Greatness:&nbsp;**Malls should partner with
      the best, or at least the most appropriate. Luxury brands have long known
      that there are times when collaboration is the key to success. There are
      countless examples of capsule collections, co-branding, etc. and the mall
      industry seems to have begun to understand this too. Successful mall
      brands will take this to the next level. By turning their food courts into
      chef-curated food halls, hosting high-caliber, unique events or perhaps
      handing over creative reins to an outside party, malls could transform
      themselves into places to see and be seen.


      **4. Be an Inspiration:** Malls should develop authentic-feeling, high-end
      offerings and special projects that are both indispensable and
      inspiring.&nbsp; Mall brands need to look at how successful luxury brands
      connect with people on both an aspirational level and more directly.
      Branding is all about creating meaningful connections to people. Like
      luxury brands have understood for years, it is key to balance rational and
      emotional messaging. Mall brands cannot be pastiche. They must be
      authentic destinations that satisfy the (formal, physical) shopping need
      along with the (conceptual/attitudinal) desire for elevated and unique
      experiences that shoppers now demand.​

      Like luxury, mall brands need to exceed expectations, surprise and
      delight, impress and engage.

      It is time to disrupt the world of mall branding just as the rest of
      retail has been turned sideways. By emulating or learning from luxury
      brands, smart mall brands will become significantly more meaningful and
      important to people. In doing so, they have the potential to enmesh
      themselves in modern culture in ways previously unimaginable.​
