      For some Spirits brands, summer means big business, so I've decided to
      visit three different kinds of stores to check out Luxury Spirits Brands'
      in-store promotions. I'd like to see how brands are attracting consumers
      and getting them to reach out, grab the bottle and make the purchase.





      **COSTCO**





      My first stop is Costco. In big-box stores, there's very little opportunity
      for any kind of promotional materials (signage, banners, etc.). These
      places are all about the product, and that's where the promotions are
      generally found. First I come across a 1.75L Patr&oacute;n Silver Tequila
      with a branded pitcher. It looks fairly high quality, and the sheer size of
      the box is attention-getting. Patr&oacute;n usually executes at a very high
      level and I think this is a great idea for making a batch of margaritas.
      But here's the thing, the recipes on the back are for single drinks. OK,
      I suppose there are any number of possible reasons for not featuring
      a batch recipe on the box (legalities, oversight, etc.) and margarita
      recipes can be located in seconds via smartphone, but that really seems
      like a missed opportunity.​





      Bombay Sapphire caught my attention with a really high-end take-one recipe
      card. It's been extremely hot out, and the quality of the photograph makes
      you want to reach right into that card and take a cool drink. Had Bombay
      Sapphire used an inferior image, I might have walked right past.





      **TAKEAWAY**





      There's a big opportunity for Luxury Spirits brands to stand out from their
      competitors with some well-crafted POS (Point of Sale) materials in this
      busy but brightly lit environment. Quality imagery, solid messaging and
      good instructions – it's the details that matter most in making the
      connection between brand, product and consumer.​





      **STEW LEONARD'S WINE & SPIRITS**





      The last stop for the day is Stew Leonard's Wine & Spirits. Wow. The store
      is large and there's merchandise and POS everywhere. Clearly, the intent is
      to excite the shopper with options. The sales floor is crowded with
      competitors in every category screaming for attention. I see virtually
      every kind of POS and display unit all in one location but here's the
      thing:​

      I also find a 1.75L Bulleit Bourbon VAP (Value Added Pack) with two branded
      glasses. The box is totally on-brand (high quality materials, understated
      graphics, well-considered design) and the glasses, which I happen to own,
      are really nice for drinking Bourbon on the rocks.





      Nice job Bulleit. (Full disclosure: The O Group has done work with Diageo,
      who owns Bulleit.)





      I am really surprised when I come across the Cointreau-Kirkland Signature
      co-pack. Why? Even though the pairing makes perfect sense (Cointreau tastes
      much better than Triple Sec in margaritas), I think it's a bit unusual for
      a well-known brand to be packed with Costco's house brand, Kirkland. The
      box itself has three margarita recipes on the back, along with some
      Cointreau brand copy and a history of the margarita on the sides. I think
      people will make the purchase in response to the "Just add Tequila"
      message. Pretty good work. (Again, full disclosure, we've done some work
      over the years with R&eacute;my Cointreau USA.)​





      TAKEAWAY





      This co-pack is a clever way to educate consumers on how to upgrade their
      margaritas with Cointreau. It will push trial of Cointreau, while allowing
      Kirkland to share a portion of Cointreau brand equity. The big-box store
      environment subverts any negative pull from the "added-value" messaging, as
      consumers are willing to give even Luxury brands permission to utilize this
      tactic during warehouse-style shopping.





      **BUY RITE LIQUORS**





      The next stop on my journey is Buy Rite Liquors, a chain with about 45
      locations across New Jersey. I've heard Buy Rite referred to as a discount
      store but I've never really perceived it as being specifically aimed at low
      pricing (not usually a Luxury brand tactic), so it should be interesting to
      see how Luxury brands are activating in this space. Although this location
      appears to be quite new, it's small and has a pretty minimal Spirits
      selection. There are a handful of VAPs and shelf-mounted take-ones.





      **TAKEAWAY**





      So what are Luxury Spirits brands doing within this space that works (for
      me)? Again, a well-thought out VAP like the St. Germain "Apertif Kit" that
      tells me clearly how to use the product. It's great. Also, Hennessy Cognac
      (yes, another former client) has a simple, acrylic shelf-mounted piece that
      helps unify and call attention to their bottles. It's understated and
      cool.





      Try to remember the shopper's state of mind. I was slowly making my way
      through the store specifically to observe, while an actual consumer would
      be faster and would likely be seeking out specific products to purchase.
      Benefit brand-based messaging will cut through the noise and clutter better
      than traditional Above-the-Line advertising headlines​





      **ALL IN ALL?**





      While mass Spirits brands can always rely on discount pricing to capture
      the attention of consumers, Luxury brands have to be more creative. For
      Luxury Spirits brands there's a huge in-store opportunity: added-value
      seems to work in big-box stores, while well-crafted materials with good
      imagery, messaging and content will connect with consumers. It really comes
      down to properly considering a consumer's pre-existing perception of the
      brand, because after someone crosses the threshold into these spaces any
      number of executions and distractions can steer them toward or away from
      brands and products.





      Luxury Spirits brands would be better served to pivot away from just trying
      to increase visibility with posters and banners, and instead develop
      engaging promotional materials that provide education and/or a clear
      functional benefit to consumers.​
