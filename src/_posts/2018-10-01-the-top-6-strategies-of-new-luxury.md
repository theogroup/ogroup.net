  As a branding agency with over 30 years specializing in the Luxury sector, we
  often get asked: *“What does Luxury mean today?”* and *“How do luxury brands
  today differ from heritage luxury brands?”.&nbsp;*


  What we have observed with our clients over the recent past (both start-ups
  and successful businesses needing rebranding) is that traditional luxury
  branding models are wearing thin (mostly) and are losing efficacy in today’s
  marketplace. Why? The luxury audience has evolved and the definition for what
  is considered luxury has evolved with them. No longer is the luxury consumer
  driven by consumption alone and this outdated buying habit has even become
  distasteful in the eyes the “enlightened”.&nbsp;


  We are in the middle of yet another economic and branding evolutionary shift:
  moving from an Experience Economy (where customers seek out and prefer
  enjoyable experiences over products) and entering a Transformational Economy
  (where experiences are elevated from mere enjoyment towards a preference for
  personal transformation). In this new economy, the consumer becomes the expert
  and authority - they are their own agents of change - their own brand that’s
  in a constant state of becoming. Luxury brands who want to maintain relevancy
  in this arena of transformation should consider exactly how their products and
  services can become vehicles for supporting their customers personal brand and
  enable individual and collective change.&nbsp;


  The continued rise and pervasiveness of brand marketing concepts like
  Sustainability, Flexibility, Responsibility, Transparency, Integrity and
  Authenticity have become the elevated standards in many industries, including
  Luxury. Through a wide variety of tactics and applications, New Luxury employs
  these “elevated” concepts to help become part of a upgraded brand landscape.
  Targeted and helpful programing and activations, uncovering strategic
  alliances and sponsorships, producing new forms of educational experiences and
  developing innovative product technologies are all employed as effective means
  in illustrating credibility with consumers today.&nbsp;


  Over the past few years, we have identified 6 specific strategies for Luxury
  business wishing to connect with an evolved consumer. Not all of these
  directions can be or should be adapted for every brand, but there are at least
  a few (for any business) that could be looked in an effort to participate in
  the New Luxury landscape.&nbsp;

      **#1 COLLECTIVE / SHARED&nbsp;**


      *Definition: A group that shares in a brand experience, product or service
      and the bonding that comes from the collective interaction before, during
      or after being shared.&nbsp;*


      **Brand Value: Belonging&nbsp;**


      Being part of something larger then yourself and participating in a
      movement or collective effort is a powerful motivator for brand adoption.
      SOULCYCLE has done a great job on evolving a long standing fitness
      activity (spinning) and transforming a standard membership into becoming
      part of a tribe of like-minded participants and sharing in the same
      collective experience together. Gucci has a nod towards this strategy in
      their recent campaign that recalls 1960’s counter-culture visuals, product
      development and copy which has reflects a distinct anti-establishment
      resonance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      **#2 ACCESS / DEMOCRATIZATION**


      *Definition: Making a product or service more widely available - making
      your brand more accessible and obtainable for more people. &nbsp;*


      **Brand Value: Connectivity&nbsp;**


      This strategy seems to be in direct opposition to the Luxury mentality -
      if you create products that are widely available to everyone, can you be
      considered a Luxury brand any longer? A great example of a thoughtful
      implementation that increases a brand value of connectivity at the same
      time as protecting a brand’s luxury credibility comes from the
      Herm&egrave;s / Apple collaboration. By introducing the Hermes brand to a
      new generation of potential brand advocates (at a much lower price point),
      both brands benefited by the association and alignment.&nbsp;


      **#3 ETHICAL / TRANSPARENCY**


      *Definition: Being honest and forthcoming about how products and services
      are made, where materials and manufacturing comes from and adopting
      ethical and sustainable business practices though the entire brand supply
      chain.&nbsp;*


      **Brand Value: Authenticity&nbsp;**


      One of the “oldest” and most established strategies for connecting with
      aware consumers is the area of ethical transparency and sustainability.
      There are many ways Luxury brands can be authentic with customers and
      improve the “feel-good” aspect of the purchasing process. DeBeers “Forever
      Mark” program has been wildly successful in addressing the ethical issues
      inside the diamond businesses problems with African sourcing and human
      rights issues. &nbsp;

      **#4 ON-DEMAND**


      *Definition: Making your products or services available faster and more
      readily than usual - allowing customers to come and go as they wish and
      letting them drive brand adoption to meet their lifestyle choices.&nbsp;*


      **Brand Value: Freedom&nbsp;**


      There has been a growing cultural shift away from ownership and towards
      on-demand use has been one of the largest global transformations (Uber,
      Lyft, Airbnb, etc.) in the past decade - adopted by mass and luxury brands
      alike. This approach is not easy to implement for many businesses that
      already have a fixed product offering but start-ups have been building
      their business offering around this strategy with great success like
      private aviation brand JetSmarter which makes luxury transportation fluid
      and provides the ultimate travel freedom.&nbsp;

      **#5 SELF-ACTUALIZATION**


      *Definition: Helping to facilitate customers self-improvement goals:
      physically, mentally, spiritually or professionally.&nbsp;*


      **Brand Value: Fulfillment&nbsp;**


      The self-improvement market has been on a steady climb for decades but the
      Luxury industry has recently become aware of how to leverage this trend
      within product and service offerings. Seabourn cruses have been offering
      some of the most luxurious experiences in the travel sector - but has
      started to add more wellness programing to their with their trips with
      their Wellness Cruises - entire journeys dedicated to personal fulfillment
      and self-actualization.&nbsp;

      **#6 CUSTOMIZATION**


      *Definition: Allowing for customers to customize or personalize a product
      or service and add their own “mark” of individuality and identity to the
      finished product or experience.&nbsp;*


      **Brand Value: Recognition** &nbsp;&nbsp;


      Not a new strategy for luxury brands but one that has been increasing in
      popularity over the past few years is this ability for consumers to place
      their own “ mark” onto an existing luxury product. Not only does this
      strategy add additional engagement streams and touchpoints but it places
      the customer at the center of the brand experience and raises the level of
      personal recognition to a visibility rarely seen in the luxury market.
      Louis Vuitton’s Mon Monogram program is a good example of how this is done
      well and for them, very much on brand.&nbsp;
