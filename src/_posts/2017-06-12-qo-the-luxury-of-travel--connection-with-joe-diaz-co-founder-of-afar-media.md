      Joe and his co-founder, Greg Sullivan, came out of Teach for America,
      started travelling together, and soon realized there wasn't a player out
      there talking about travel in a meaningful way. And so AFAR was born.





      **ORIT**: YOU LAUNCHED THE MAGAZINE AT A TIME WHEN THE ECONOMY WENT TO
      SHIT, WHICH IS PRETTY AMAZING. I THINK THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO WHAT AFAR
      STANDS FOR; IT WAS A WAY TO LOOK AT TRAVEL IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT.





      Joe Diaz: I think what you're talking about is at the core for us at
      AFAR—travel starts with a mindset. For AFAR, travel is less about where
      you're going and more about the how.





      **ORIT**: PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WONDER HOW AFAR FITS INTO OUR Q&O SERIES,
      WHICH REALLY FOCUSES ON LUXURY BRANDS. I WOULD CONSIDER AFAR A LUXURY
      BRAND, BECAUSE THE ACT OF TRAVELING AND OPENING UP YOUR MIND TO NEW
      EXPERIENCES IS A LUXURY IN ITSELF.





      Joe: Right. Doing what we love is obviously a luxury, and traveling the way
      we do is a luxury as well. I think we bring a different ingredient to the
      luxury conversation, which makes us an interesting player. It's not about
      bling; it's about trying to make these experiences personal.





      Our advertisers certainly confirm that what we're doing here has luxury
      appeal—we have Singapore Airlines, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Mercedes, etc. We
      deal with a lot of high-end brands who really want to talk about luxury in
      the way that we do.





      **ORIT**: WHAT'S BEEN YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE WITH THE MAGAZINE?





      Joe: We've come into an extremely crowded and competitive space. Being
      a media company in the modern world, you're fighting battles on a lot of
      different playing fields. So what we do in print and our competition in
      that space is different than what we do in digital. We have such an
      enormous opportunity in this space because no one has really talked about
      travel this way, and it's really fascinating for me to see now how recently
      brands have moved toward talking about the types of things we do.​

      Five years ago you didn't see any of our print competitors talking about
      this, now they all do. When all of a sudden you have a lot of players
      speaking the same language, it makes the conversation a bit vanilla, so
      we're always looking to innovate and push the envelope. In a world that
      changes so rapidly, the challenge is how to stay ahead of the curve and use
      our mission and values to guide our growth.





      **ORIT**: TALK TO US ABOUT YOUR DIGITAL STRATEGY.





      Joe: That was a challenge in itself. We didn't know, when we started, what
      it was going to be. We just knew that whatever we did had to serve the
      travelers, had to abide by this mission of what we stand for: inspire and
      enable travelers to have deeper, richer, more authentic experiences. Today,
      we're the world's most comprehensive guide for discerning travelers.





      There are a lot of sites out there that try to cater to all different types
      of travelers, but there hasn't been a media brand out there that has
      created a comprehensive digital guide for discerning travelers. Our
      visitors come away with an amazing trip plan that inspires and enables them
      to get beneath the surface of where they're going. That's really what our
      website and mobile app used in tandem are designed to do. That's the core
      of it; you're going to go on AFAR.com and get amazing content that you can
      engage, save, like, share, and ultimately be able to have those experiences
      in the places that you're researching.





      **ORIT**: IT SEEMS LIKE INNOVATION FOR AFAR ISN'T JUST YOU GUYS SITTING
      AROUND, BUT HEARING WHAT PEOPLE WANT AND LISTENING TO BRANDS THAT COME TO
      YOU WITH CHALLENGES.





      Joe: Success is about thinking about what will keep us ahead of the curve.
      We really believe in what we do, that in itself is a luxury. We need to
      continue to stay true to our passion and mission, and that's all about
      telling really good stories that connect emotionally with people. If we can
      do that on every platform, we're going to be in a really good place. It's
      been a fun ride thus far!





      **ORIT**: WHAT'S NEW, WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE NEXT YEAR?





      Joe: Content licensing is going to be a big part of our business. You'll
      see a lot more partnerships with bigger brands, to help drive their
      businesses through the content that we're producing on AFAR.





      **ORIT**: I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON THE AFAR EXPERIENCE A BIT, THAT'S PRETTY
      INNOVATIVE COMING FROM A MEDIA COMPANY!





      Joe: It's a cool story of how they got started. It was February 2011, when
      Mubarak stepped down from power. I was in New York, Greg was in San
      Francisco, we're talking and he's like,​

      Three days later we were in Cairo, Egypt—we went because we were curious.
      We had the chance to meet all of these amazing people on the ground. From
      ministers, to Egypt's first female judge, to some of the guys who started
      the revolution, women's rights activists, designers, editors of the papers.
      We were floored. We knew our audience would thrive on meeting all of these
      people in the places they live and work, and they would really appreciate
      understanding what's going on in this country in a deeper way.





      Nine months later, in October of 2011, we brought thirty people to Cairo.
      None of them had ever been before. We had an incredible time meeting all
      these people, having this access, making personal connections. Within sixty
      days of that trip, 20% of the group had gone back for a second time, so we
      knew we'd created something pretty special. "AFAR Experiences" turned into
      another aspect of the business for us.





      **ORIT**: I THINK WHAT RESONATES ABOUT AFAR IS THAT THE CONSUMER EXPECTS
      A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE OF A LUXURY BRAND, AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT AFAR
      BRINGS TO THE TABLE.





      Joe: I appreciate that. For us, at the end of the day, you might not
      remember all of the details, but you remember how you felt. I think that's
      what it all comes down to – how do we feel when we're engaging in those
      life experiences? If we can feel as if something is opening up our world,
      that's a good thing. That's what we're trying to do.





      **ORIT**: WHAT ARE YOUR PERSONAL LUXURIES? AND YOU CAN'T SAY TRAVEL!





      Joe: It's ironic – I got to do a lot more personal traveling before AFAR!
      One of my personal luxuries is being able to be surrounded by incredible
      people, listening to great stories, and seeing the world through other
      people's eyes. That to me is the greatest luxury.​
