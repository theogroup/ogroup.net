      First on my hit list this year is picking the brain of the ubiquitous Greg
      Furman, Founder and Chairman of the Luxury Marketing Council since 1994:
      1000 luxury brands, 5.000 CEOs in 57 cities. Through his organization he’s
      touched nearly every facet of the luxury industry. To learn more about
      Greg’s past, including time with Sun Oil, J Walter Thompson, The New York
      Stock Exchange and Bergdorf Goodman, visit his bio here.









      If you know Greg, you’ll know he’s never short of an opinion on this
      industry. So let’s get to it!









      **Among other major US retailers, Macy’s has announced significant store
      closures in early 2016. Does this point to a larger trend?​**

He knows how to motivate, inspire and focus his strategy. So who better to deal with this equation than he. I think the media has played it all wrong.​'

      Most of the media coverage has focused on the market’s shortcomings. But
      really this is an intelligent consolidation, liberated by the web,
      segmentation capabilities and marketing. Consider that America is vastly
      over-stored with 43 square feet of retail for every person versus 9 square
      feet of retail in the UK, the second largest in terms of retail space.









      So this wonderful combination has enabled Terry to choose premium locations
      that provide in-depth retail experience. And then shift the difference out
      of deep investment in property to a more enhanced, bespoke and customized
      marketing.​

I would also say that the pressure in this environment is on brands to be true, classic, integrated marketers—and luxury brands have been relatively slow to adapt but are recognizing that that approach is critical.​'

  - text_markdown: 'We know that Macy’s 40 stores slated to close account for 1% of total sales, even though they make up more than 5% of Macy’s locations. It’s no secret that the Macy’s store experience has grown a bit tired in plenty of markets. Especially as compared to far superior retail experiences that exist within the same shopping center—like Apple or even Nordstrom. The outlets were aging, and while that’s not the primary cause for closures as Greg pointed out,​'

      I’m not so sure it’s sprawling square footage and lots of inventory
      anymore.









      The internet provides unprecedented access to product, but I believe bricks
      and mortar is still critical—but brands who don’t consider how to bring
      technology into retail and evolve the brand experience will fail.​
