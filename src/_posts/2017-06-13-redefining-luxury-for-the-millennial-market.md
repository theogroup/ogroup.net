      Everlane, along with brands like Warby Parker, Indochino and even the newly
      launched ‘How About We' (a dating site that provides members with
      a complimentary concierge service) are doing something compelling in the
      prestige space. They offer all the consideration and it-factor of a luxury
      experience, but with a sense of innovation and transparency a lot of the
      ‘traditional luxury' brands find hard to achieve.





      This wave of "one-foot-in-the-door" luxury brands is cutting through the
      noise and pushing boundaries—not just of what it means to be a "brand" in
      this category adjacent to luxury, but also of how to create
      a "share-and-repeat" worthy experience. It's clear that this category of
      brands is disrupting the way millennials think about luxury… but how?





      A high degree of product quality is a given, but the true standout factor
      is that these brand platforms echo millennial generation values—what we
      want from the brands we "like".





      **1. DIGITAL BRANDS FOR A CONNECTED GENERATION**





      This category has upended the traditional brand model entirely—goodbye
      brick and mortar, courting buyers, building a reputation through
      advertising, sharing space in high-end department store lookbooks, and so
      on. It's not so much that digital is a key component of this sort of
      brand—digital IS the brand. Of course, there are other, slightly older,
      brands that have grown up digital—take Gilt Group or Fab, for example, and
      what's intriguing about these in particular is that they're now taking
      advantage of, or resorting to, traditional mediums (e.g. TV ads).In the
      case of Gilt, their commercials still catch me a little off guard. It's as
      if it's hard to make the connection between the brand I check daily on my
      iPad, and the clothes parading across my television. I do feel as though
      these digital brands are bound to and ought to take the next step—but the
      transition is new and a little unfamiliar right now, to brands and
      consumers alike.





      **2. RESPONSIVE BY DESIGN:**





      When it comes to forging a connection with a generation that's unafraid to
      experiment with technology (let's be honest, you switched on your new
      iPhone to figure it out, while your parents went searching for the manual
      hidden deep in the box), this category has knocked it out of the park.​

      And it's not with a Facebook post or an Instagram feed. Indochino hosts
      travelling tailor events, Everlane is opening a pop-up shop in Canada for
      it's vocal followers, and the list goes on. There's undeniably an element
      of connection and social share-ability that even the best-trained team of
      brand ambassadors would find hard to recreate.





      **3. CONCISE STORYLINE:**





      We're busy and constantly connected—brands need to cut through the noise,
      offer something different and better, stand for something and tell that
      story clearly and concisely. This category of brands doesn't have a long
      history to stand on, so they need to hook their loyalists through honesty
      and a personality that resonates with a generation always looking for the
      opportunity to share. It seems that transparency + worthy product + value
      proposition + a cohesive digital and social experience = success. On the
      note of transparency, millennials don't really care that these brands may
      not be as uninterested in profit as they claim, because they offer us
      a package we want, and a brand mission we identify with.





      **4. CURATED CONTENT:**





      In this marketing/branding world, we all know the immense value attached to
      content marketing—it's the golden goose of every company out there, and
      it's no surprise to millennials that it's caught on like wildfire. We live
      public lives, sometimes in parallel to our private lives; sometimes
      altogether different. Point being, millennials are in the habit of curating
      their public presence for the online world, and expect brands to do the
      same. It's not just about blogging about happenings, it's about pulling in
      outside content and offering it up in a curated and thoughtful manner—these
      brands let their personalities show in a personal way, and their loyalists
      can't get enough.





      So, that's ‘one-foot-in-the-door' luxury in a nutshell. It's not about
      a luxury price tag; it's all about a considered experience. These brands
      are like a custom made suit for an entire generation—and I expect they will
      grow and adapt to be just as enduring mainstays in our consumer culture.​
