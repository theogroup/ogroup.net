      Malls have long existed as a centralized hub of consumerism and cultural
      connectivity, strategically designed and built in locations to receive the
      most traffic. In 1989, when malls experienced a rapid growth across
      America, [photographer Michael Galinsky beautifully captured the cultural
      phenomenon of the shopping mall as central to social life across the
      country](http://rumur.com/malls-across-america/). While his photos now
      transport viewers to a bygone era of big hair and acid washed jeans, they
      also represent a look at a cultural touchstone the start of a 30 year
      erosion.

      The descent of the mall has been driven by a number of factors: the
      proliferation of e-commerce, consumers’ desire for more unique or
      locally-made business and brand options, and the rise of development
      orchestrated "town-centers" to name just a few. Despite this shift, the
      potential for shopping malls (and the businesses within their walls) to
      regain consumers’ attention remains real – ​

      but only if malls and their tenants truly understand the value that
      consumers now place on experience.

      In the journal of Psychological Science, Gilovich, Killingsworth and
      Cornell doctoral candidate Amit Kumar, expanded on the current
      understanding that spending money on experiences, "provide(s) more
      enduring happiness." ([Nicely summed up here by The
      Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/buy-experiences/381132/))
      They looked specifically at anticipation as a driver of that happiness;
      whether the benefit of spending money on an experience accrues before the
      purchase has been made, in addition to after. And, yes, it does.

      Shouldn’t the mall experience evolve to capitalize on how consumers’
      predilections have evolved? Consider the positive effect that will come
      from creating a lasting experience within the mall environment. A viable
      avenue toward delivering a lasting experience involves the infusion of
      consumer-friendly technology.

      According to&nbsp;[Bain Consulting’s Leading a Digical
      Transformation](http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/leading-a-digical-transformation.aspx),
      "Straight-line extrapolations of digital dominance miss some important
      insights. We humans are physical and social beings. We like to go out, to
      interact in person with other people, to touch and handle and make things.
      The real transformation taking place today isn’t the replacement of
      physical by digital, it’s the marriage of the two into combinations that
      create wholly new sources of value."

      The key for malls is the incorporation of technology that responds to
      shoppers’ wants and needs, and at the same time serves as inspiration for
      consumers to modify how they approach the physical shopping experience.​

      Malls should consider using technology to create a fluid and personalized
      journey through the mall that delivers unexpected engagement along the
      way.

      Speaking of mobile technology, "showrooming" has become a common part of
      our lexicon. It’s nearly impossible to prevent savvy shoppers from
      attempting to find the best price for the products they desire. That said,
      malls have an opportunity to take advantage of the showrooming trend by
      demonstrating the added value of brick and mortar experience as a
      complement and value add to mobile.

      Will we ever return to the shopping mall’s heyday? Perhaps not, but that’s
      not necessarily a bad thing. Fashion, media, and technology have all
      evolved over time, and the way people shop is no different. The key for
      malls is to continually improve the experience for consumers by
      reimagining what the physical space can offer as well as using technology
      to provide added value and make the shopping centers responsive to
      ever-changing consumer behavior.​
