      I first stumbled upon the vast building on 7th Avenue between 16th and 17th
      Street a few weeks back while returning from a client meeting. I had read
      the articles in all my favorite fashion magazines of the rumbles of the
      Feb. 2016 opening, but seeing the large Barney’s banner on the
      fa&ccedil;ade made it seem real.

      Being a downtown girl myself, the idea of having this luxe department store
      steps away from my home was enough to fill my dreams with blissful downtown
      shopping trips that no longer involve weekends spent on the 6 train
      schlepping uptown.​

      The location is the perfect solution to the fashion-forward crowd who
      resides downtown and prefers to stay there. Trekking up to Madison Avenue
      isn’t always a downtown girl’s idea of fun. This prime Chelsea location
      also fits in perfectly with the development of Hudson Yards as well as
      residential buildings popping up on the Highline. It provides a sigh of
      retail relief for all the millennials with disposable income working nearby
      at Google and Twitter who may need a lunch break fashion fix.

      I'd be remiss not to mention the fact that the 17th Street space is where
      Barneys first opened in 1923. This re-opening in the original neighborhood
      makes me love the brand even more. There is something about a uniquely New
      York retailer returning to its roots, that builds a sense of heritage and
      trust with consumers. At the same time, the Chelsea neighborhood now is
      obviously completely different than it was then, and Barneys seems to want
      to gain the hearts of this new army of fashion frontiers. The brand is
      capitalizing on the buzz of the chic location of the space and maximizing
      the visual impact of the "Instagrammable" white spiral staircase, the image
      that keeps surfacing across social media as the unofficial, "I’ve been to
      the downtown Barneys and you have not" shot.

      Yet, the brand isn’t relying solely on the buzz of the downtown opening to
      remain relevant. Sales associates inside the store are armed with iPads and
      you can pay on the spot with Apple Pay. The brands featured in-store cater
      to the downtown crowd and the interior design aesthetics are modern and
      more manageable that the uptown location.​
