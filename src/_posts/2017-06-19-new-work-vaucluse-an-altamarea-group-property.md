intro_markdown: "Vaucluse, Chef Michael White and Altamarea Group's newest property, launched to acclaim last month (check out some of the great press their team has gotten in the NY Times and on wwd.com.) We're proud to see our visual branding and logo design work come alive within such an incredible concept.​"

      The Vaucluse brand identity is warm and timeless with an understated
      elegance. The lush color palette and attention to detail invite guests to
      enjoy traditional dishes from across the Southeast of France.





      Vaucluse is the fourth property we've worked on with Altamarea Group, and
      Chef Michael White's first concept to focus on the quintessential core of
      French cooking. There's no stopping the NYC-based hospitality group
      powerhouse, and we're happy to be along for the ride.





      Check out some of our work and the Vaucluse space (impeccably designed by
      NYC-based design boutique Meyer Davis) below!​
