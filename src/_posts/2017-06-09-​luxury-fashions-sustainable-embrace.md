      There’s widespread talk about the impact of the fashion industry on our
      planet’s eco-system, and these are excellent strides in the right
      direction. Fashion with a conscience can only become the norm when leaders
      are at the head of the revolution. The world watches all that they do and
      their progress proves ethical considerations can be met - and with the
      utmost of elegance.

      Stella McCartney is one such designer. Her eponymous fashion brand features
      all vegan garments and accessories, many of which are created with
      sustainable materials. What is interesting is that her sales see serious
      growth year after year, as does the percentage of sustainable items in her
      collections.

      Gucci’s 2017 Men’s Outerwear Collection is made of… sustainable fabrics.
      The Italian fashion house surprised everyone with its first foray into
      eco-friendly materials. The collection will consist of a special textile
      called ECONYL. ECONYL is able to be completely regenerated and it’s made
      entirely of salvaged waste products such as excess material produced by
      manufacturing plants.

      With the most accessible luxury price tags of this group, Reformation is
      still undeniably luxurious with some of the most in demand designs of the
      moment. In fact, the L.A.-based online retailer is now available at another
      great web destination, none other than Net-a-Porter.com. The brand aimed at
      Millennials prides itself on sustainable materials and production while
      teaching shoppers how to live more sustainably. All the while, Reformation
      remains on the lips of those in the know with an array of ever-changing,
      beautiful clothes and tongue-in-cheek marketing.

      Finally, Kering is leading the way as a conglomerate that cares… in the
      world of fashion at least. Their aim is to back the fashion houses under
      their umbrella striving towards greater sustainability success. It’s an
      excellent message from a firm that certainly has the finances to fund it.
      It’s interesting to note that both Gucci and Stella McCartney are Kering
      brands along with the likes of Alexander McQueen, Pomellato, Saint Laurent
      and others. The conglomerate also backs a few sports and lifestyle brands,
      Puma being the most recognizable.

      Historically, fashion was never about sustainability, and yet here are some
      of the most well-established creators of luxe goods rethinking how high
      fashion can be done. This is about seeing luxury through a new set of eyes.
      Using research, technology and forward-thinking ideas, they’re setting the
      standards for the industry worldwide. Their actions say luxury can be
      ecologically-friendly and highly desirable.

      Realistically, if creative industries can’t innovate when it’s time to
      change, who can? We’re looking forward to see how other fashion houses
      respond.​
