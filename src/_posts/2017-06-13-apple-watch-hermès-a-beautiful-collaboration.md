intro_markdown: 'The recent Apple event announcing a suite of new products, as well as updated versions of existing products, certainly captured the attention of fans and foes of the brand. While there were a handful of announcements that set the internet ablaze, it was an interesting and somewhat unexpected partnership that really got The O Group office buzzing.​'

      I'm talking about the Apple Watch Herm&egrave;s, a collection that combines
      Apple's innovative smart watch with the sophisticated styling of one of
      high-fashion's most respected heritage brands. According to representatives
      for both brands, the partnership is a marriage of design philosophies that
      are more similar than one might think.





      Said Pierre-Alexis Dumas, Herm&egrave;s' executive vice president in charge
      of artistic direction, "At Herm&egrave;s, we strive to provide our clients
      with elegant, creative and functional objects for their everyday lives.
      What more contemporary and relevant expression of this principle could
      there be than this collaboration with Apple. We are strongly united by the
      same deeply held ideas and principles."​





      This partnership shouldn't have come as a surprise to many, as the
      conversation about the Apple Watch's place within the luxury category has
      been bandied about for a while now. Despite serving as a piece of
      technology, many consider the Apple Watch to fall squarely in the luxury
      space because of its desirability, and the fact that it comes from a brand
      that has expertly blurred the lines between form and function.​

      Now that Apple has a highly-respected fashion house in its corner, the
      brand has firmed its place within the luxury category. Combining its sleek
      design and interface with the lavish materials so often found in
      Herm&egrave;s' designs creates a symbiotic relationship that will
      undoubtedly lead to interesting partnerships between Apple's competitors
      and the fashion world in the coming months.





      We're excited to see what's next​
