intro_markdown: 'With neither the high-end distribution nor the advertising dollars of traditional luxury offerings, brands new on the scene today are forced to innovate in order to compete. But as they do so, their innovations make them not just competitive in a saturated market, but leaders who elevate the status quo, stealing market share from their established counterparts along the way.​'

      It's splayed across their website clear as day. The e-commerce retailer,
      "cut out the middleman", and a supremely simple info-graphic stands by to
      explain exactly how that perfect t-shirt arrives at your door. They've made
      a genuine effort to be transparent on multiple levels (corporate,
      production, sourcing), and to deliver designer-level quality at
      "disruptive" prices. The brand platform of transparency, exceptional
      quality and a curated experience echoes through every touch point.





      **Ecommerce user experience**





      Everlane is one of a growing number of brands that have begun to champion
      this movement of ‘fewer but better.' By offering a limited selection of
      pieces, they're able to keep price competitive in the gateway-luxury
      segment, as well as raise the ecommerce experience to the high-end level.
      That commitment to constructive minimalism is reflected across their
      website. The design is simple and beautiful, and clearly built with the
      user experience top of mind—the user and the way they might interact with
      the website is the foundation for construction, rather than an afterthought
      of the design.





      **Product is still king**





      None of this argument would hold up if the product didn't deliver on their
      promise of luxury-quality goods at more palatable prices. All else equal,
      the product quality has to be at LEAST equal to the quality of the
      experience. From the moment you click "purchase", the experience mimics the
      higher-end in-store experience. Your order arrives in a timely manner in
      a thick brown pack with ‘Everlane' stamped boldly in black ink on the
      outside—the paper is rough, pulpy, and almost seems handcrafted. Inside,
      the product is rolled in a way that prevents wrinkling, wrapped in tissue,
      and closed with a branded sticker—on top there's a romance card, with
      a simple thank you.





      It's the in-store experience translated beautifully to digital.





      **Ongoing brand relationship**





      Like any brand worthy of millennials' loyalty, Everlane is an accomplished
      curator of highly share-worthy content. They continue to touch their
      followers in a way that is unlikely to send consumers searching for that
      difficult to locate "unsubscribe" button. Rather than reaching out in
      a "You left items in your shopping cart" way, their emails and posts are
      product and content oriented, and diverse enough that they don't seem
      automated, even though we know they are.





      The ‘PK' Polo announcement is a great example of this – just enough of an
      interesting tease (their go-to "It's coming!" photo teaser) to get people
      talking in-person (especially in this office!). It creates, in an odd way,
      that in-store experience of getting excited about the piece, talking it
      over with your friend, debating the purchase, being encouraged to try it
      on, etc. It comes as no surprise that when a coworker of mine reached out
      with a fit concern, the Everlane team responded promptly and with
      a unequivocal answer—the tone was direct and authoritative, yet didn't come
      across as automated. How perfectly on-brand.





      **An eye toward the future**





      It's a new wave of online luxury. While brick and mortar brands continue to
      test the waters of translating their brand to digital, brands like Everlane
      that have grown up purely digital are blowing them away in terms of
      connecting with the millennial generation—a generation that has, in turn,
      grown up on MySpace and Facebook, Flickr and Instagram, Napster and
      iTunes.​

With such strong brand DNA, it's clear that these one-foot-in-the-door luxury brands are poised to react and adapt as the world changes, and encounter success as a result.​"
