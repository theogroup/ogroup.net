      One is a newspaper. I'm serious. Inside is Shinola's brand campaign
      (credit: Partners & Spade), featuring Bruce Weber photography of Detroit
      "icons" (poets, teachers, students, etc.) alongside evocative copy, both
      more prominent than any product. The second is a brochure telling the
      Shinola story, and highlighting the team behind the product. These Shinola
      materials have sat on my desk for the past week or so, waiting for me to
      figure out how to articulate what they make me feel ("awesome" wasn't going
      to cut it). In the meantime, I took a trip down to the Steven Alan (20 Year
      Anniversary) & Shinola Block Party in Tribeca to see if a visit would help
      sort out my thoughts (it did).





      In Tribeca on a humid Thursday evening, the Shinola / Steven Alan gathering
      featured Roberta's (a New York pizza institution) and George Dickel (a
      whisky that prides itself on "doing things the right way"). As I strolled
      Franklin Street, debating whether I realllly needed that dress, it hit me.
      It all centers on time, and the value Shinola places on it. Whether that
      manifests itself in a respect for the past, a commitment to the time it
      takes to produce anything of quality, or the investment of time (and
      dollars) in growing a business and brand the right way—it's what makes the
      brand so captivating.





      It's why the pseudo newspaper / brand manifesto / campaign that Shinola
      produced and distributed at the Lincoln (a fellow Detroit supporter and
      supporter of innovation in industry) booth makes perfect sense.​

      And not just any print. Newspaper: a medium symbolic of American industry
      and growth, one that many discount as a relic of the past. To promote their
      Detroit-centric, American-made, skilled-labor dependent, luxury goods
      business via newspaper is just…so on point. To feature brand values ("the
      spirit of Detroit") more prominently than anything Shinola actually
      produces speaks volumes to the type of brand they're building: it's about
      connection, creating a relationship with consumers that takes time to
      build, and probably costs more money than they make – at least initially.
      It's about investing in building a legacy for a brand that carries the name
      of a once iconic, now forgotten shoe polish. To that end, it's fitting that
      the opening pages of the brochure display only "Our Story" and "Our
      Craftspeople."





      At the end of the day, plenty of brands with big budgets spent a lot of
      money to produce fancy booths and materials for this show. Only one brand
      has really held my attention for some time: Shinola. They just thought long
      and hard about their values and printed them on newspaper so people like me
      would keep it on the corner of their desk (at this point, indefinitely),
      instead of tossing it away without a second glance. All that goes to say,
      a luxury brand's mission and values are critical to creating real,
      emotional connection. Never underestimate the value of clearly articulating
      both to the world.​
