      **O:**&nbsp;Having had such a diverse upbringing, which part of exploring
      new cultures excites you the most in a new country?

      **Carmen:**&nbsp;I am Cuban born but was raised in the U.S., and grew up
      with the stories of the paradise that was wrecked and left behind.
      Ironically, I didn’t leave the U.S. until my 40’s and I know immigrants in
      the U.S. from so many countries. So travel for me is partially a way to
      explore all the “lost paradises” that people have come from or in some
      cases, gone to.

      **O:**&nbsp;What are the most vital elements to making travel luxurious?

      **Carmen:**&nbsp;Luxury travel for me means a facility that has both the
      desire and the means to provide a superior experience for their guests. The
      reality about travel is that while it’s exciting, it can be difficult
      sleeping in different rooms and beds. With luxury travel, each hotel is
      a thrilling experience with comfort, beauty, and attention to the guest’s
      experience.

      **O:**&nbsp;After a decade of indulging in opulent travel, do you prefer an
      experience that has been curated for you or do you like to have more
      control over your trip?

      **Carmen:**&nbsp;In most cases, I prefer to have more of a curated trip,
      although having some input is often useful. To organize a trip properly
      requires significant research in advance and someone familiar with the city
      and its highlights. However, I really appreciate when they ask questions
      like how much walking do I want to do, how long do I want to spend looking
      at certain sites, and so forth.

      **O:**&nbsp;What have you observed as the latest trends in luxury travel?

      **Carmen:&nbsp;**I’d remark on a few trends, some contradictory. I have
      found that luxury travel used to isolate travelers from any local flavor
      but recently, they’ve provided increased access to local culture. I’ve also
      noticed an increasing number of extremely upscale resort hotels, which
      provide a very luxurious cosmopolitan experience, which is totally detached
      from its location. With the National Geographic Tour through Israel, there
      was a distinctly educational aspect of the tour, which also seems to be
      a growing trend.

      **O:**&nbsp;Think back to your first decadent trip- how has luxury travel
      changed between then and now?

      **Carmen:**&nbsp;Hotels seem to have realized that in addition to upscale
      furnishings and dramatic sites, they also have to deliver consistently
      superior service and comfort. My husband’s pet peeve for instance is
      whether hotels make it easy for him to plug his phone in at night next to
      the bed. Like everyone, he uses his phone as his alarm and needs to charge
      it at night. It used to be that luxury hotels did not have an easy way to
      access on each side of the bed. Recently, the number of hotel rooms that
      require moving furniture or leaving the phone across the room have
      dwindled.

      **O:**&nbsp;How do you go about choosing your next destination?

      **Carmen:&nbsp;**Like Dr Doolittle, I just take a pencil and an atlas,
      close my eyes, open the atlas, and point the pencil. Well, not really but
      I’ve always been charmed by those books and the whimsy of how he chose his
      next location. Really, I start with a list of places I’d like to see or go
      back to, and then see what destinations are open to working with me. In
      addition I consider locations my traveling companions (hopefully my
      husband) want to go.

      **O:**&nbsp;What does Rethink Luxury mean to you?

      **Carmen:**&nbsp;For me, the future of luxury is not in ever-bigger rooms
      or more extravagant furnishings. It’s about attention to comfort details
      and providing staff with the expertise and motivation to really help guests
      navigate their travel experience.​
