intro_markdown: 'The future of digital marketing has arrived to the luxury arena. Virtual reality (VR) is finally a serious contender with improved technology and more considered applications. It’s being embraced by the likes of Charlotte Tilbury, Tommy Hilfiger and even the House of Dior as a powerful means for reinforcing a brand.​'

      However, VR technology is not enough to make an impact. A luxury VR
      campaign must be authentic, relevant and exclusive. Entertainment is also
      an essential element and a great way to get shoppers into brick-and-mortar
      stores.

      Let’s examine the aforementioned brands. All three offer in-store VR
      experiences at select shops around the globe. Charlotte Tilbury’s
      experience led by Kate Moss may also be enjoyed online for those equipped
      with the proper gadgetry. Tilbury’s move into VR was to promote her first
      fragrance, Scent of a Dream, whereas Hilfiger and Dior promoted recent
      fashion shows.

      All three brands did an exquisite job at driving store traffic with the
      piqued interest of brand fans and what was likely to be a first-time VR
      experience for many of their clients. Tommy Hilfiger’s version brings users
      into the 360 degree world of a fashion show. Guests have up close views of
      the designs, the models and fashion row guests. While it is authentic and
      relevant, the only aspect that feels exclusive is the opportunity to view
      the event through the eyes of a VR headset. If the VR aspect is removed,
      it’s the same scenes shoppers can peruse online.

      Dior expertly met all three points by taking guests backstage, with an
      emphasis on exclusivity. The behind-the-scenes experience is truly
      exclusive with the prepping of models and expert makeup artistry that may
      only be viewed in stores. What’s more, with their 3D, high-definition
      presentation, all points were considered. They were ever careful to align
      every element with the Dior brand. This means even the high-tech VR headset
      was designed by an in-house team. This ensures an aesthetically appropriate
      device with an emphasis on quality, hallmarks expected from a luxury firm
      in fashion.

      Virtual reality presents an incredible opportunity to truly immerse clients
      in the most opulent, branded experiences. It’s an effective way to build
      a stronger emotional connection with your clientele. Every detail may be
      considered in advance so they’ll meet the same standards of excellence
      - every time.​
