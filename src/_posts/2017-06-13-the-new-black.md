      But what struck me was actually a Budweiser billboard that proclaimed its
      "Black Crown" brew to be the drink of choice selected by and for "the
      finest in the nation". See "Black", read "Luxury". Now where have I seen
      that before?





      Rewind to New York Fashion Week—with throngs of fashion's elite, many clad
      all in black, inundating Manhattan. In honor of the event, designer Reed
      Krakoff and famed French p&acirc;tisserie Ladur&eacute;e collaborated to
      create a limited edition, matte-black macaron. That's right, a luxury
      dessert in ever-fashionable black.​

      It all really started in 1999 with the American Express Centurion Card, an
      invitation-only credit card offered to clients who meet certain very high
      (yet provocatively undisclosed) net worth and annual spending criteria. The
      Centurion Card, which is black, has long been informally known as the Black
      Card.





      American Express may have owned the "Black" branding space for a while, but
      over the past few years brands across virtually every category have
      attached "Black" to their name and rested comfortably in the knowledge that
      consumers understand this means Luxury with a capital "L".





      In some cases, like Ralph Lauren Black Label apparel, Gucci Black perfume,
      and Porsche Black Edition, brands do actually have luxury DNA and heritage
      to support the brand platform. In other cases, including Puma's Black
      Label, which houses products done in collaboration with high-end designers,
      the luxury DNA is not as strong, but arguable. And then there are spirits,
      where black labeling has been the most prolific and has been adopted across
      mass, mid-tier, and luxury products. In addition to the aforementioned
      Budweiser Black Crown, there's Jameson Black Barrel, Guinness Black Lager,
      Malibu Black Rum, Evan Williams Black Label, and Hennessy Black, among
      others.





      All of this black labeling raises a big question: Will luxury brands
      continue to leverage black as a key brand attribute? I don't think so, and
      history as well as best practices in brand strategy agree with me.





      In the 1990s, everything had to be "Clear" – the American Express Clear
      Card, Pepsi Clear, Zima (the clear malt beverage – remember that one?), and
      the clear iMac (which was totally revolutionary at the time).





      By the 2000s, "Clear" gave way to "Platinum": the Sony PlayStation Platinum
      Range, platinum wedding bands rather than gold, Zino Platinum Crown Series
      cigars by Davidoff, Patron Platinum, and countless "Platinum Collections"
      by brands across categories from vacuum cleaners to cars.





      Luxury brands establish and differentiate by positioning themselves above
      everyone else in their category. They do this in a variety of ways,
      including but in no way limited to naming. Before it caught on like
      wildfire, brands stood out for having a "black label" and were perceived as
      being a cut above the rest, or at the very least as being different. But
      now that so many brands have a black label, true luxury brands will
      doubtless push forward and find new means of distinguishing themselves.





      There are a few directions beginning to take hold, all of which
      (thankfully) appear to be slightly less contrived than the ubiquitous
      application of the Black concept.





      The first trend gaining serious momentum in the luxury space is
      Craftsmanship.





      This isn't something new – trends don't have to be – but in post-recession
      times, it certainly provides justification for bigger spending at higher
      price points. Whether it's handmade, handcrafted, small batch or artisanal,
      now is the time to learn how to properly pronounce "terroir" once and for
      all. If there's any doubt in your mind, look at the Luxury-ization of beer:
      Craft beers like Oskar Blues Dale's Pale Ale and the whole line from
      Sixpoint Brewery in Brooklyn are reframing beer as upscale and gourmet.





      Brands who pull back the curtain and communicate their tenets to consumers
      are utilizing the next big thing in Luxury: Straightforwardness and
      Transparency.





      Take clothing company Everlane – they are open and upfront about their
      business model, profits, and manufacturing. Couple that with classic,
      timeless clothing, and they've primed the brand for consumers as a model of
      post-recession cool. Another player in the clothing space utilizing the
      same trend, Bonobos, works on the premise that guys need better pants and
      clothes that fit properly at a reasonable price. Simple enough, right? The
      fact that the brand recognized that men would seize upon the opportunity to
      buy that clothing in a comfortable, non-demeaning and straightforward way
      established Bonobos as a new kind of fashion leader.





      Lastly, what's old is new again.





      The oldest trick in the book, Shared Brand Equity is here to stay. While
      celebrity endorsements and brand partnerships date back to the beginning of
      branded promotions, Social Media is redefining the way these relationships
      are conceived, executed and either accepted or scrutinized by the public.
      By thinking harder and creating more evocative and compelling brand
      partnerships, this trend seems ready to gain momentum and greater influence
      in the very near term. You only need to look to Diet Coke (which seems to
      view itself as a fashion brand as much as a cola) and Marc Jacobs with
      a sexy, on-brand buzz-generating campaign vs. Diet Pepsi and HGTV designer
      Vern Vip coming out with something that feels second-rate and purely
      decorative.​
