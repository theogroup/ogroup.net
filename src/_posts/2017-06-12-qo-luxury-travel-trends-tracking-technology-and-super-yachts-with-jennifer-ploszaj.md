      Jennifer founded&nbsp;[JP
      Communications](http://jp-communications.com/)&nbsp;in London in 2011
      following a 20-year career in marketing, communications and PR for the
      luxury travel and consumer lifestyle sectors. JP Communications partners
      with forward thinking clients to provide strategic brand marketing and
      communications guidance.





      **ORIT**: TELL ME WHAT GETS YOU OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING!





      Jennifer Ploszaj: I love that question! Usually my personal trainer or
      a client in Asia!





      **ORIT**: WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO START JP COMMUNICATIONS?





      Jennifer: Over 20 years I've had the privilege of working with many
      brilliant agencies. Whether they were creative or communications I've
      always envied the environment: they're encouraged to push the boundaries of
      strategy and creativity. I thought it would be a great challenge to take
      the skills I have in luxury travel and hospitality and apply them in an
      agency format.





      I was also driven to work with like-minded people who are building,
      disrupting or transforming their businesses or industries. Most of my
      clients are entrepreneurs, and I love working in that freethinking
      environment.





      **ORIT**: SO ON THAT NOTE LET'S TALK A LITTLE ABOUT NEW LUXURY BRANDS!





      Jennifer: The word "luxury" isn't defined in the same way it was even five
      years ago. Luxury is personal. And new brands need to be extremely targeted
      in their approach. These customers have always been elusive and are even
      more so today. New brands must intimately understand customer behavior on
      and offline to effectively reach them. And equally important, they need to
      continually develop products and services that stay relevant and appeal to
      their target.





      **ORIT**: HOW DO BRANDS BUILD THAT CONNECTION?





      Jennifer: Brands build connection the same way people do:​

      A great example of a brand getting that right is Tiffany's. I was in their
      Fifth Avenue store a few months ago and purchased something. The sales
      assistant mailed me a hand written note to London! It was small, but so
      powerful. I haven't experienced that from a luxury brand in a while.





      **ORIT**: SO HOW DO HERITAGE BRANDS SPECIFICALLY REMAIN RELEVANT?





      Jennifer: When you think of a heritage brand that's been really successful
      and remained relevant Burberry immediately comes to mind. What Angela
      Ahrendts and Christopher Bailey did with the trench coat: bringing
      a traditional, not very glamorous piece back to the forefront of the brand
      and using technology to create communication channels like the ‘Art of the
      Trench,' and putting the coats back in runway shows was incredible. They
      made the trench and the brand's heritage relevant again across multiple
      demographics.





      **ORIT**: WHO WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE AS A TRUE INNOVATOR IN THE TRAVEL
      INDUSTRY?





      Jennifer: AirBnB. I think the uproar has proved that they're disrupting the
      travel industry. Their business model is on trend in terms of how customers
      are making travel decisions. They're leveraging technology to cut out the
      pain point of empty inventory. Their entire brand is digital. It's
      spot-on!





      **ORIT**: HOW ARE TRAVEL BRANDS USING TECHNOLOGY TO TRACK THEIR CUSTOMER
      ABROAD?





      Jennifer: Hotel and airline loyalty programs are the primary tool for
      tracking preferences and buying patterns. They help brands to anticipate
      needs and reward repeat business- it's pretty standard across the travel
      industry.





      With mobile, travel brands can now communicate with customers in real time,
      during their journey. Brands will know where their customers are, exactly
      when they're arriving and what services they want upon arrival.





      Brands are experimenting with a variety of technology – in some unusual
      ways. An interesting example is how some boutique resorts are using fitness
      technology to build a deeper relationship with their repeat guests.
      Technogym is a fitness equipment brand that allows people to develop
      personalized programs that can be managed online. The personal fitness
      teams at the resorts can use this technology with their guests during their
      vacation. When the guest returns home, the resort team can continue the
      connection by providing on-going fitness support or guidance. The point
      here is not the focus on the fitness program or the technology itself, but
      rather, using these things as tools to build strong customer relationships.
      It goes back to our earlier discussion…brands that will succeed in the
      luxury sector are those that know how to build meaningful relationships
      with their customers.





      **ORIT**: I WONDER HOW WELL IT WORKS – THAT IS, HOW LONG THE GUEST
      CONTINUES TO INTERACT WITH THE HOTEL?





      Jennifer: Data shows that very high net worth individuals tend to travel
      a lot and much of this time is leisure travel – eleven or more weeks
      a year. Among those travelers there's a high repeat rate. And like all of
      us, they appreciate personalized attention and service. This is a tool that
      provides a subtle connection, and it seems to work.





      **ORIT**: WHAT DOES THE LUXURY CONSUMER WANT FROM BRANDS THAT THEY CHOOSE
      TO FILL THEIR LIVES?





      Jennifer: I think the word "fill" is really important to this question.​

      There's an argument that technology is making us less connected to each
      other within society. But interestingly what we see in the luxury travel
      sector is that these customers are actually looking for something more
      meaningful. They want to spend more time in a single place, and forge
      a connection with the place and other people.





      **ORIT**: I HEAR YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT SUPER YACHTS!





      Jennifer: It's a fascinating industry! What's so extraordinary to me is the
      level of craft that goes into building a Super Yacht. It takes three years
      on average – you can build a hotel faster than that! All of these skilled
      people come together to create something incredibly beautiful, but also
      very powerful and highly technical. I was recently in Monaco meeting with
      a team of naval engineers, architects and designers; it was an
      extraordinary host of characters so skilled in something very specific.





      If you choose to build the yacht it's a personal passion, and often a labor
      of love. Many of these yachts are like second homes. The owner is involved
      in every step, and the result is very much a manifestation of their
      personality.





      **ORIT**: HAVE YOU FOUND THAT THERE'S A PERSONALITY PROFILE FOR THE
      TARGET?





      Jennifer: At this level, there are probably several hundred people in the
      world who can afford to count themselves among the "target." People may
      immediately associate Super Yachts with women in bikinis and bottles of
      champagne, but that's just one facet – there's another world that's much
      more subtle and elegant.





      **ORIT**: NAME ONE PERSONAL LUXURY THAT MIGHT SURPRISE EVEN ME!





      Jennifer: This won't surprise you: not wearing shoes! Shoes aren't
      permitted on a Super Yacht, and it's very liberating. When everyone is
      barefoot there's something really equalizing about that. I wonder how our
      thinking would change if we held barefoot meetings?​
