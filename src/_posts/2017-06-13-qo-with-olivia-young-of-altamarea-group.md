      During her career with Altamarea Group, Olivia has brought their media
      efforts in-house, and now oversees the group's nine restaurants worldwide.





      **ORIT**: WHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR BRANDS IN THE CULINARY
      INDUSTRY?





      Olivia Young: Differentiation. Brands in the culinary industry tend to be
      focused on a chef or person because they're so identifiable. Then those
      people physically expand beyond the restaurant with product lines, whether
      it's pots and pans, home-ware lines, etc. That's a large part of defining
      a culinary brand.





      As far as differentiating yourself in the restaurant category, there's
      a migration toward really fantastic food- whether you're creating a luxury
      dining experience or launching a food truck and creating a brand around
      that.





      **ORIT**: I THINK THIS WHOLE FOOD TRUCK TREND IS SO INTERESTING. IT OPENS
      UP THE CULINARY WORLD FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T CULINARY EXPERTS OR HAVEN'T
      EXPERIENCED FINE DINING– SINCE WE'RE FOCUSED ON LUXURY HERE, WHAT'S YOUR
      TAKE ON FOOD TRUCKS?





      Olivia: Food trucks make exciting food accessible to the average consumer
      who might not have the desire or the means for fine dining. They also give
      chefs from fine dining backgrounds the ability to do something a little
      more fun or experimental with their skill.





      There's been a curve in the food truck trend. Chefs started these trucks
      and they were huge in Southern California, Miami and New York. Now, because
      they've become so wildly popular and received enough funding, they're
      expanding into brick-and-mortar. It's a cool concept, and it allows chefs
      to do something that's more fundamental and requires less capital. It's
      also about accessibility– it gives consumers the ability to try something
      that they couldn't necessarily afford before.





      **ORIT**: WHAT COMES UP A LOT IN THESE Q&O CONVERSATIONS IS THE
      "EXPERIENCE" – HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR A CONSUMER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
      A BRAND IS ALL ABOUT. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE FOOD TRUCK CRAZE IS THAT
      EVERYONE'S STANDING ON LINE, AND THERE'S PROBABLY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE
      TRUCK AND THE FOOD. IT'S MORE INTERACTIVE THAN SITTING AND LOOKING AT
      A MENU.





      Olivia: In light of luxury, these trucks are serving artisanal products
      from a truck which seems so "rear-history", but it's also very luxurious.
      You can stand in line at Wafels & Dinges for a waffle that's covered in
      Speculoos paste or fresh fruit with cream because you want a really
      luxurious waffle—you don't want to just make an Eggo waffle in your
      toaster. There's an enormous difference.





      In light of Fashion Week, even fashion or designer parties have gotten into
      the craze. Instead of paying for catering, food trucks are a cheaper and
      trendier option to satiate the partygoer's palette.





      **ORIT**: WHICH BRANDS IN YOUR CATEGORY WOULD YOU CATEGORIZE AS "BEST IN
      CLASS", AS COHESIVE THROUGHOUT THE BRAND EXPERIENCE?





      Olivia: When it comes to a cohesive experience from the moment you walk in,
      I'm drawn to Hillstone Restaurant Group. You walk in and everyone appears
      friendly and poised, they're dressed casually but very well. I'm confident
      in saying that every meal I have had at Hillstone is almost the same. Is it
      luxury? To me, that's luxury.​

      **ORIT**: OUTSIDE OF YOUR CATEGORY, CAN YOU THINK OF A BRAND THAT YOU WOULD
      CALL BEST IN CLASS?





      Olivia: In the fresh pressed juice category, Juice Press is clearly best in
      class. The staff is welcoming, the packaging is well branded, and the
      quality of the product is beyond any other company. They have locations all
      over Manhattan, which makes it easily accessible, and they deliver. While
      the price is a bit high, it's worth it. They make the experience fun and
      enjoyable. Health nuts can be too intense, or take themselves too
      seriously. The Juice Press experience (and product) just makes you want to
      drink juice!





      **ORIT**: WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THE SUCCESS OF A BRAND IN
      THE CULINARY OR RESTAURANT INDUSTRY?





      Olivia: Quality of service and product, strong internal leadership, great
      management and having employees who love what they do and convey that to
      the customer.





      **ORIT**: YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FOOD TRUCK MOVEMENT EARLIER, BUT WHAT'S NEW,
      WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH RESTAURANTS OR HOSPITALITY BRANDS RIGHT NOW?





      Olivia: It went from food trucks and comfort foods, to locally grown
      produce to the "How close can I get to the fish I'm eating tonight?"
      concept.





      What I'm seeing in New York City is that chefs are returning to doing what
      they love. Harold Dieterle opened a German-Italian restaurant, The Marrow,
      that goes back to his heritage. I don't know if it's a "trend" that these
      chefs who were lauded for what they did are now opening places that really
      cater to what they love—they're just cooking what they like to eat. Even
      Chef Michael White went back to his roots with retro-supperclub The
      Butterfly, cooking classic American style food paired with cocktails.





      On a simple level, the luxury of fine dining is all about the product, so
      there's a huge fixation on purveyors. Altamarea Group has been approached
      recently by companies that are aimed at making local available on a larger
      scale. These companies are making local sourcing possible on a mass digital
      scale; they offer chefs the ability to buy meat from the local farm of
      their choosing, for example. It's like e-commerce for local foods. It's an
      involved process, but it's worth it for the restaurant and chefs because
      you know where you're getting every single product, and that's seriously
      luxurious.





      When you look conversely at someplace like London when it comes to dining,
      they've gone off in a totally different direction. Their fixation is
      restaurants that just serve one thing. There's a place called Bubble Dogs;
      they only serve hot dogs and champagne. There's another place called Burger
      & Lobster, and that's it- you can only choose between a burger or lobster!
      Luxurious simplicity, I guess. Why not?





      **ORIT**: YOU KNOW, I'VE TRAVELED ALL OVER, AND THE FOOD IN LONDON WAS
      NEVER MEMORABLE, THEY GET A REALLY BAD RAP FOR FOOD.





      Olivia: They do, but I have had two of the best meals I've ever had in
      London. They've really picked up the pace.





      **ORIT**: WHERE WERE THOSE MEALS?





      Olivia: At Heston Blumenthal's at the Mandarin Oriental in Hyde Park
      & tapas at Barrafina in Soho.





      **ORIT**: THIS TREND THAT YOU'VE SEEN OF ONE OR TWO MENU CHOICES—HAS THAT
      HAPPENED IN THE U.S. AS WELL?





      Olivia: I think Americans are obsessed with options, and we're not simple
      enough to embrace it. Here in New York there's PDT (Please Don't Tell),
      which has cocktails and hotdogs from Crif Dogs served at a super exclusive
      bar.





      In Paris there's Le Relais de l'Entrec&ocirc;te where all they serve is
      steak frites. I think that would be a wonderful concept to recreate in NYC
      with super high quality meat. People would love that, but there would have
      to be a way to serve top quality and avoid premium prices. Do I think that
      trend is here right now? Not really. Even someplace like Shake Shack has
      options, and that's considered rather simple. I think as a society we enjoy
      that luxury.





      ORIT: WHAT ARE CUSTOMERS EXPECTING OF THESE LUXURY RESTAURANT BRANDS?





      Olivia: When it comes to paying money for food, there are so many options
      and it's so expensive. It has to be a really wonderful experience beyond
      the food.​

      Consumer research and the Internet has allowed companies to research and
      store data to create consumer profiles—it makes the consumer's experience
      even more luxurious due to personalization. While it's not necessarily
      professional to greet a person by name the first time they visit, it's
      certainly nice to let them know you remember them upon their return.
      Customer profiles list preferences, special occasions, dietary
      restrictions, but the experience is also about the added touch: remembering
      the wine they drank, the dessert they loved. It's about making that person
      feel important and special, making them feel that they've spent their money
      well, because they could have gone anywhere else.





      **ORIT**: RIGHT, BECAUSE THE FOOD CAN BE AMAZING, BUT IF THE HOSPITALITY'S
      NOT THERE, IT CANCELS EVERYTHING ELSE OUT.





      Olivia: Of the last couple of unbelievable dining experiences I had,
      I probably recall two of the 25 courses I ate. It was the entire experience
      that was phenomenal, including the company I was with.





      It also has to be kept in mind in the hospitality experience that the
      employees really have to love where they're working and whom they're
      working for, because that's immediately apparent to the customer. So if
      you're the manager of the restaurant and you're having a bad day, and you
      open your mouth and explode at the customer, that's it. You've ruined the
      experience, and they'll never come back there and they'll tell others. As
      opposed to walking into Celine for a handbag: you can greet me and tell me
      how beautiful the bag is, but I walked in knowing that. The experience is
      more objective in retail. On the other hand, if I'm sitting down for
      a four-star meal, spending the time and paying $400 a head, I want to be
      treated like a queen for as long as I'm seated.





      **ORIT**: WHAT ARE THE STANDOUT HOSPITALITY BRANDS BRINGING TO THE
      "TABLE"?





      Olivia: Luxury and consistency. If I could talk about my own group for
      a moment, it's important to maintain the luxury status of a brand. We do so
      by constant R+D at Altamarea Group locations, but also outside of the
      group. My CEO eats at AMG restaurants constantly and offers nonstop
      feedback. It's an ongoing conversation. That said, our obsession with
      luxurious and consistent experiences parlays to our customer.





      We're building the Altamarea Group brand so that people can go to Nicoletta
      for pizza and a beer, or go to Marea for extravagant caviar and oysters,
      and know that they're going to have a wonderful experience regardless of
      price point. The idea expands to London and Hong Kong as well, with Al Molo
      and Chop Shop—customers know and trust the AMG brand, and it not only makes
      them feel closer to home, but takes some of the risk out of going to
      a restaurant in a foreign city. It's that guaranteed consistency of
      experience that goes into building a luxury brand.





      **ORIT**: WE'VE TOUCHED ON THIS A FEW TIMES—EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE, WHAT'S THE
      SECRET? DOES AMG HAVE A SECRET FORMULA?





      Olivia: Altamarea Group began because the former president of Merrill
      Lynch, Ahmass Fakahany, made a career change. He left finance for his love
      of restaurants, made an investment and partnered with Chef Michael White.
      Altamarea was founded by a serious passion for the industry. That passion,
      it trickles down to the headquarters, where there are likeminded people who
      love the company and industry. From there, the employees at the restaurant
      are not only well trained by top managers, but the managers are well
      trained by the CEO. Ahmass meets with each manager every single week to
      make sure there's no disconnect between the property and upper management.
      In meeting with the managers, chefs, waiters, he empowers employees to
      share the vision he's creating for the company, and shares his hope of
      expanding the company and brand globally, with great product and great
      people.





      **ORIT**: I'VE NOTICED YOU HAVE PEOPLE FROM THE AMG FAMILY THAT ROTATE
      AMONG YOUR RESTAURANTS. TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT.





      Olivia: Our turnover as a group is so much lower than the industry
      standard, because our corporate culture is all about employees enjoying
      what they do. Someone who begins as a sous chef or a line cook can grow to
      become a chef at multiple properties within Altamarea. There's no reason
      for them to go elsewhere because AMG is expanding rapidly and there's
      opportunity for personal growth.





      Ahamass, Chef Michael White and upper management are all so interested in
      what everybody wants to do and where they see themselves in the future. We
      don't see it as hiring a waiter, we see it as hiring someone who will serve
      and work at AMG for an unforeseeable amount of time.





      **ORIT**: LASTLY, WHAT ARE YOUR PERSONAL LUXURIES?





      Olivia: A $40 spin class at Soul Cycle, a boxing trainer, Juice Press, an
      unbelievable pair of shoes, a meal at the French Laundry, staying at the
      Savoy in London, too much Laurent Perrier Rose Champagne—things that are
      instantaneous or that leave lasting memories. I think everybody should
      indulge, and cost isn't a qualifier of indulgence.​
