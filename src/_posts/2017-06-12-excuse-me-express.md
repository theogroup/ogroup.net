      Instagram and Facebooks ads, Vogue Daily and Who What Wear articles have
      been serving up a slew of content from the forgotten brand, Express. It was
      actually a Vogue Daily article featuring the beloved Gigi and Kendall
      wearing matching Express Sherpa jackets that caused me to elevate this
      situation to straight talk with another fashion-forward co-worker of mine.
      How in the world is Express carrying the new "it" jacket, why is it only
      $60 and most importantly, since when is Express relevant again?









      It seems I wasn't the only one of my girlfriends who had noticed the large
      amounts of marketing dollars Express had been spending. After the initial
      shock, I began to wonder...​

      While the Sherpa jacket led me down this rabbit hole, it was the new
      "athleisure" line Express was promoting that made me actually throw a few
      pieces into my online shopping cart. "EXP Core" is the retailer's new
      performance line where, "fashion meets fitness." While the tagline lacked
      originality, I was willing to look past it due to the cute Lululemon-esque
      tops they had to offer, and in true Express form, a "BOGO 50%" deal
      attached to each one.









      After a week of regaining interest and scouring potential gym outfits
      online, I ended up purchasing two workout tops. One—because I thought they
      were cute, two—because of the BOGO (I'm a bargain hunter at heart). Whether
      or not Express is truly making a comeback has yet to be seen, but
      I definitely found myself feeling just a little nostalgic for those high
      school days roaming the mall and wandering into Express in search of a new
      top for the high school dance.









      Express may not be making a move to position themselves outside of mass,
      but they are rethinking what an elevated mass retail offering can evolve to
      be, and they definitely knew how to bring back a previous customer. It was
      as if they knew I had grown up. Mini skirts were no longer applicable, yet
      a trendy workout top to wear to Equinox next week could reel me back in. It
      made me wonder: maybe a few write-ups in my favorite fashion sites and
      a 50% discount really can do the trick. That said, I think it will take
      a sustained effort from the brand for more millennials like myself to put
      Express in their active-wear or fashion consideration set.









      How do I know Express still has a long way to go to relevance? When another
      girl at the gym asked where my new top was from and I told her she
      responded, not surprisingly, "Excuse me, Express?"​
