      But when it comes to surveying the state of your luxury brand, it is
      invaluable to step back and judge your brand the way the luxury consumer
      will – by its weakest point of execution.Luxury consumers have a clear set
      of expectations. They consistently reward brands that deliver exceptional
      products, services and experiences. On the flip side, like all consumers,
      they are quick to turn to social media when a brand does not measure up,
      and luxury brands have a lot to measure up to. A quick glance at Facebook
      or Yelp will confirm that a mediocre experience rarely warrants a review.
      Indeed, only the incredible or the incredibly disappointing earn mentions.
      Luxury brands, which must carefully consider every angle of execution, are
      all too aware that a single scathing remark can easily negate five rave
      reviews.

















      So, where have we seen luxury brands that otherwise get it right go wrong?

















      **INCONGRUOUS BRAND PARTNERSHIPS**

















      Would a AAA Four Diamond hotel partner with a fast food franchise?
      Remember, not every opportunity is right for your brand.

















      **LOWBROW "SALE" MESSAGING**

















      Would an iconic Fifth Avenue flagship store in New York advertise
      a "Blowout Sale"? While to some extent discounting is a reality of almost
      every brand, there is a right and a wrong way to go about it.

















      **INCONSISTENT COMMUNICATION AROUND A SINGLE CONCEPT**

















      Often in the luxury auto space, careful consideration is given to every
      aspect of curating a product's identity. Despite all that care, that same
      luxury car sometimes ends up on display in your local mall. Take care not
      to contradict your own messaging.

















      **POOR TASTE**

















      Off-color humor or pointed politics can easily alienate many people.

















      These gaffes are the equivalent of walking into an iconic luxury boutique,
      having a memorable experience with a representative, finding the ultimate
      piece of couture and then being handed the garment in a crumpled plastic
      bag without tissue. One element can ruin it all.​

      Sounds smart, but, as a result, an equally dangerous trend has emerged:
      Luxury brands are consistently late to the game, letting fear of failure
      deter them from strategic innovation. So, what happens when half of your
      competition is standing at the edge of the water, afraid to dive in?
      A crowded space becomes less crowded, offering enormous opportunity.

















      For example, the digital / mobile / social space feels pretty risky to many
      luxury brands. Technology is moving at warp speed, so the platforms of
      today may change even as you develop a strategy. Still, it is clear that
      luxury brands must accept that the digital space is just another touch
      point in which to excel and grow, or fail. Look at Jimmy Choo's digital
      success. It invested in a Facebook presence and gained a following of
      1 million fans. And it does not let those fans sit idle. Its "Trainer Hunt"
      launched across Facebook, foursquare and Twitter, was covered on 250
      different blogs and was the most clicked story on PRWeek's news site.
      Through a smart digital strategy, Jimmy Choo reinforced for its current and
      aspirational consumers that its product is to be coveted.

















      Another brand that pulled ahead through innovation is BMW. The German
      automaker's "BMW Genius Everywhere" strategy arms brand experts with iPads
      and a deep technical knowledge of the product. It has made it clear to the
      consumer that these experts are available to provide information, and if
      consumers would like to make a purchase, a salesperson can assist them. The
      BMW strategy is really genius. It is on-the-spot content marketing
      – selling without overtly selling. Its risk seems to be paying off with the
      program now slated for implementation in the United States in early 2014.

















      **WHAT TO DO?**

















      So what is a luxury brand to do when there are so many ways to go wrong? It
      is critical to have well-articulated branding documents including brand
      DNA, mission and vision, and to make sure those documents are well
      understood companywide. With this groundwork in place, when one of these
      opportunities comes about, you are ready to react in the right, on-brand
      way rather than doing something that may cause more harm than good.
