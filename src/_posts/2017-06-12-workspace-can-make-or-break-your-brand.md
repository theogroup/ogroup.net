      As I’ve learned lately, there is also no shortage of content advising on
      the pros and cons of different types of workspaces. I’ll leave that
      discussion to the interior design experts. Instead, I’d like to focus on
      the relationship between workspace and your brand.

      When done properly, good retail environments are literally built around
      brand experience. Successful property management companies and retailers
      are dedicated to location, the economics of the deal, and building out
      profitable and engaging spaces. But what about office space? So much of our
      work at the agency focuses on restaurants, hospitality, retail and home
      decor. So, as new physical experiences are emerging in retail, lifestyle,
      live/work, places like Pirch, Brookfield Place and WeWork, along with the
      prevalence of working remotely (as I am today), the choice of where to work
      and how to utilize your space as a brand asset is especially relevant.

      Just like your website, logo, social media and other assets, your office
      space communicates with prospects and clients or consumers. Your choice of
      headquarters is a part of your brand. If your brand is fun, collaborative
      and targets millennials, your space ought to reflect that. If you were more
      focused on corporate work with big financial firms, you would create
      a totally different vibe. A highly considered space should evoke both
      rational and emotional responses, so carefully controlling that experience
      for team members, prospects and clients can provide an impressive nudge in
      the right direction – or be a disappointing let down.

      Brands who want to get the most for the their rent dollars must leverage
      their positioning to inform an office selection and design.​

      Brand consideration during office design and development forces brands to
      look inward and forward at the same time. Purge, cleanup, reminisce and
      move on – not only with physical but also with how you think about your
      brand and your business too.

      Just as we do on creative work for our clients. I recommend you articulate
      how your office space addresses your Category, Culture and Consumers or
      Clients. A redesign or move can be exciting. A new space can symbolize
      a fresh start. Seek out opportunities to use the move as the impetus for
      new ways to enhance your process. Breakout spaces, working walls, audio
      visual equipment, client meeting space and amenities all must be carefully
      considered to ensure proper alignment.

      The O Group has been in our current office for ten years. Over that time,
      our business, our brand and our work have changed significantly. When we
      started in this space, we were 25 people predominantly functioning as
      a high-end graphic design and production firm. We’ve rebooted our brand
      twice and launched 3 websites over the course of the last 10 years, just
      a third of our agency’s 30-year history. The world changed. Millennials
      have risen. The O Group formally introduced strategy and reconfigured our
      processes and services to better suit the times. We’ve looked closely at
      what we have to offer, reorganized the structure of our team and have
      targeted a new clientele via an agency repositioning.

      By now, you may have guessed it. We’re moving. Collaboration, with our
      clients, with partners and internally, has become more critical than ever
      before. We spend less time at our desks and more time out in the world.
      Sometimes we work form home, on the road, at our clients and in the cloud
      (literally and figuratively). Our new office will be smaller yet more open
      and connected. We’ll be as digitally dialed-in to the world as possible,
      but still encourage face-to-face meetings and working. We’ll be better
      set-up to do what we want to do and will function at a higher level. We’ll
      bring to life our brand positioning – Rethink Luxury – as we create
      a comfortable and highly functional workspace that we look forward to
      calling Home for years to come.​
