      **The Best of Local Seattle&nbsp;**


      Getting to know any city requires research.&nbsp; When I travel I like to
      root out places where the locals hang out. I like to be immersed in the
      spirit of a city and to see it through the eyes of people who actually
      live there day to day. Sure, there are spots in every destination that
      have stood the test of time and are worth a visit, even if it means
      contending with clueless crowds armed with selfie sticks. In Seattle, at
      the top of the typical “must see” list includes the&nbsp;[**Space
      Needle**](https://www.spaceneedle.com/),
      the&nbsp;[**Waterfront**](http://www.visitseattle.org/neighborhoods/waterfront/)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[**Aquarium**](http://www.seattleaquarium.org/?gclid=CMXD7b_08tUCFYllfgod6jABxw),**&nbsp;[Pioneer
      Square](http://www.pioneersquare.org/)**,&nbsp;[**Pike Place
      Market**](http://pikeplacemarket.org/)&nbsp;and the
      original&nbsp;**[Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/store-design/1st-and-pike)&nbsp;**cafe.&nbsp;
      All worthy stops to log into your “been there, done that” bucket list, but
      brace yourself for the teaming masses and long lines. As a longtime
      resident of Seattle and a culture and food geek, I think the best of our
      city lies outside the more expected tourist hot spots and resides in the
      unique neighborhoods that encircle the city.&nbsp;


      > Here are my top picks, I promise none will disappoint.

      **Downtown**


      2017 marks the second year in a row that the Seattle skyline boasts more
      construction cranes than any other city in the US. The city is in a major
      building boom and many areas of downtown are a traffic and navigation
      mess. Of the more expected downtown destinations, there are two I would
      recommend seeing for sure - the&nbsp;[**Pike Place
      Market**&nbsp;](http://pikeplacemarket.org/)near the waterfront
      and&nbsp;[**Chihuly Garden and
      Glass**](https://www.chihulygardenandglass.com/)&nbsp;in Seattle Center.
      Pike Place Market is a year-round farmers market - used by Seattleites and
      tourist alike when sourcing local produce, seafood, cheese and dairy,
      baked goods and specialty items. For foodies like me, it’s a must see. Get
      there early to watch vendors set up, wander through the funky shops and
      then head upstairs to the exceptional&nbsp;[**Matt’s in the
      Market&nbsp;**](http://www.mattsinthemarket.com/)(a long-standing local
      favorite) for lunch and the best view of the market.&nbsp;**[Chihuly
      Garden and Glass](https://www.chihulygardenandglass.com/)&nbsp;**opened in
      2013 and since then it’s become the most loved thing to do in Seattle on
      Trip Advisor and many other travel sites. The largest permanent exhibition
      of local legendary glass artist Dale Chihuly exceeds expectations. The
      grounds include a stunning giant greenhouse and garden that organically
      incorporates his glass art. I was lucky enough to be on the team that
      developed this project (I created all branded materials) and proud to
      share it with visitors and locals alike.&nbsp;

      **Ballard**


      About a 10-15 minute drive (depending on the ever increasing Seattle
      traffic) north from downtown takes you to the hip maritime neighborhood of
      Ballard, a powerhouse dining-shopping-drinking destination. Most people
      come out this way to see the famous**&nbsp;[Ballard
      Locks](http://www.myballard.com/ballard-locks-seattle/)&nbsp;**- the
      nation’s busiest lock system with over 40,000 vessels passing to and from
      the fresh water of Lake Washington to the Puget Sound. Fun to see and
      great for kids (especially the Fish Ladder that can exceed 100,000 salmon
      in migration) but for more lively experience, Downtown Ballard delivers.
      If you are lucky enough to be in the area on a Sunday, the&nbsp;**[Ballard
      Farmer’s
      Market](http://www.sfmamarkets.com/visit-ballard-farmers-market/)&nbsp;**is
      the best in Seattle and open year round. If organic carrots and handmade
      hemp soap are not your thing perhaps grabbing a beer is more your speed.
      Ballard has more breweries than any other neighborhood in Seattle or
      Portland. My personal favorite is&nbsp;**[Stoup
      Brewing](http://www.stoupbrewing.com/)&nbsp;**with 20 beers on tap to
      sample, enjoy and take home. Looking for just the right cocktail amongst a
      hyper-local crowd?
      &nbsp;[**Hazelwood**](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hazlewood/108150355893732/)&nbsp;is
      a celebrated neighborhood gem and just happens to be owned by my brother -
      if you go, ask for Drew and tell him I sent you! There are way too many
      good restaurants to recommend - but for out-of-towners I would suggest
      heading to&nbsp;**[Ray’s Boathouse](http://www.rays.com/),**&nbsp;an
      iconic Seattle waterfront establishment just outside Downtown Ballard with
      some of the best seafood and water views in the city. For a kickin’ Puget
      sound view complete with picnic and soft ice cream be sure to stop
      by&nbsp;[**Golden
      Gardens**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60878-d141229-Reviews-Golden_Gardens_Park-Seattle_Washington.html)&nbsp;where
      locals frolic in tepid water, play volley ball and launch sailboats.

      **Capitol Hill**


      Once the official hood of the LGBT community, Capitol Hill has gone though
      a major development spurt over the past 10 years and is at the heart of
      some of the best go-to spots in the city. The most beloved bookstore in
      Seattle -&nbsp;**[Elliott Bay
      Books](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/)&nbsp;**relocated to the Capitol
      Hill neighborhood about 10 years ago into a beautiful new space that
      maintained the spirit of the old historic Pioneer Square location–must for
      book geeks. A few doors down from Elliott Bay Books is&nbsp;**[Oddfellows
      Caf&eacute; & Bar](http://www.oddfellowscafe.com/),&nbsp;**a great spot
      for lunch and an always interesting crowd they offer breakfast, lunch and
      dinner and delicious baked goods to go. Around the corner from Oddfellows
      is the lovely and expertly curated urban
      apothecary,&nbsp;**[Sugarpill](https://www.facebook.com/SugarPillShop/).&nbsp;**Custom
      blended herbal remedies and hard to find epicurean treasures are
      thoughtfully displayed by the sage owner and my favorite holistic high
      priestess, Karyn Schwartz. Need a sugar fix? Ice cream seems to be the new
      cupcake in Seattle and Cap Hill has some fine choices, seriously consider
      checking out[&nbsp;](__notset__)**[Frankie and
      Jo’s](https://frankieandjos.com/)&nbsp;**plant based (vegan) ice cream
      shop. I know, vegan ice cream does not sound a decadent as cream based,
      but try California Cabin or Date Shake and I bet your view of all things
      vegan will be forever changed. Last but not least, save room for a local
      classic –&nbsp;[**Dick’s**&nbsp;**Drive-In**](http://www.ddir.com/) burger
      (go for the “Deluxe”) and fries - a Seattle institution since 1954. For
      great views and local gardens be sure to visit&nbsp;**[Volunteer

      **SoDo / Georgetown&nbsp;**


      Just south of the downtown Seattle is the cities’ industrial district and
      the location of our two fantastic ball parks,&nbsp;**[Safeco
      Field](http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/sea/ballpark/)&nbsp;**and&nbsp;**[CenturyLink](http://www.centurylinkfield.com/)&nbsp;**Over
      the past 20 years or so, SoDo (South Of Downtown) has been transforming
      into a destination in its own right complete with luxury high rise
      apartments and condos. In addition to checking out a game (baseball,
      soccer, football) if the season is right, go vodka tasting at the
      fabulous&nbsp;**[Glass Vodka Boutique and Tasting
      Boutique](http://glassvodka.com/)&nbsp;**on First Avenue a few blocks
      south of Safeco Field.&nbsp; Glass Vodka is a premium, award-winning vodka
      distilled with Washington state grapes (instead of wheat or potatoes) and
      flavored with some of the best ingredients around - coffee, honey and Sri
      Lankan cinnamon. A client for the past 3 years, I’ve had the opportunity
      to share the entire Glass collection of vodkas with friends and it’s
      always a huge hit for those appreciating something truly unique and
      unexpected. Across the street is
      the&nbsp;[**Filson**](https://www.filson.com/)&nbsp;flagship store - a
      local heritage brand of quality outdoor gear since 1897.&nbsp; All items
      are guaranteed for life and the travel bags in particular are the darlings
      of fashion editors and heritage brand geeks alike. Drive a little further
      south and you will hit the artistic neighborhood of Georgetown. The once
      home of the Rainer Brewery from 1878 to 1999 (a beautiful brick building
      that now houses shops of all kinds) now is the “it” spot for the coolest
      antique shops and places to eat and drink. My favorite is the lively and
      colorful[&nbsp;**Fonda La
      Cantina**](http://www.fondalacatrina.com/)&nbsp;- a family owned and
      seriously authentic Mexican restaurant and bar, complete with the best
      house margaritas and mole poblano in town.&nbsp;


      I’m happy to claim Seattle as my hometown. I love sharing it with others
      so if you have any questions or are in need of a recommendation beyond
      this article, feel free to drop me a line and ask! &nbsp;
