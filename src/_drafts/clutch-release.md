      In an ongoing effort to identify high-performing B2B service providers
      throughout the globe, Clutch recently issued a report releasing their most
      updated research of the best agencies and developers in New York City.
      Clutch, a ratings and reviews platform for service providers, has profiled
      and evaluated thousands of companies belonging to a wide range of
      industries, including IT services and development, advertising and
      marketing, social media marketing and SEO, and most importantly,
      [branding](https://clutch.co/agencies/branding/new-york).

































































      Their segment devoted to branding is one of the most extensive and
      competitive listings on their site, with some of the country’s strongest
      agencies vying for the position as the top provider for buyers seeking
      branding services. For this reason, The O Group is incredibly proud and
      excited to announce that Clutch has featured us as one of the best branding
      agencies in New York in 2017.

































































      To receive this distinction, The O Group had to prove ourselves as a strong
      and results-driven agency as determined by a few different factors. First,
      Clutch measured our presence in the branding market by looking at the
      clients we serve, the branding services we offer, and our ability to
      deliver quality projects as showcased by the [case
      studies](https://www.ogroup.net/work/) displayed on our website.

































































      Next, and most significantly, Clutch analysts spoke directly with our
      former and current clients to generate reviews for The O Group, all of
      which can be accessed through our [Clutch
      profile](https://clutch.co/profile/o-group). In creating these reviews,
      Clutch interviewed our clients with detailed and purposeful questions aimed
      at understanding how we’ve partnered with them and what sort of outcomes
      our work has produced.

































































      These reviews, combined with our branding expertise, is what has led to our
      placement on Clutch, giving us the opportunity to see how we rank compared
      to similar firms. So far, so good.

































































      Without our clients, The O Group would not be where it is today. We are
      greatly appreciative of the partnerships we’ve maintained over the years
      and could not be more proud of what we’ve accomplished together. Moving
      forward, we will continue delivering quality work for our clients so we can
      not only maintain the success we’ve had as an agency, but also continue
      rising on Clutch’s platform until we have the spot at the top of their New
      York coverage and beyond
