  AN OPEN LETTER FROM OUR CHIEF CREATIVE OFFICER.

  Change is constant. For 30 years in New York City we have experienced the ebb and flow of economic, social and stylistic trends. Relevancy is about evolution, so here we are.​

      Change has come to all forms of business, media, design and lifestyle. As
      a business, we too, have constantly evolved. Decades of strategy, creative
      and design combined with a focus on luxury constitute the backbone of our
      branding and campaign expertise.





      We deal in the business of ideas. We work with clients that value those
      ideas and our expertise.​

      In the past, luxury was exclusive and shielded. But like so many other
      aspects of life and business in the beginning of the 21st century, luxury
      is more open and accessible than ever. When executed properly, luxury is an
      elevated perspective that aims to exceed expectations.





      Luxury means something special, but it is a construct. Luxury creative can
      be a tool. It provides a framework to companies, business and brands – of
      all kinds – who want to attract people and deliver something qualitatively
      well beyond the norm.





      We uncover ways for brands of all kinds to leverage luxury creative in
      order to deliver a strong return on investment. To develop a point of view,
      to create something evocative, emotional and engaging for people who value
      aesthetics and experience. We work collaboratively with clients, partners
      and consumers to generate insights, iteratively build innovative and
      engaging creative ideas, then we execute with precision and measure.​

      We create, design and launch relevant luxury creative campaigns for clients
      in and out of the traditional luxury space. We work with brands on their
      high-end offerings, special projects and targeted executions.





      The meaning of luxury is changing. We know because it’s been our mission to
      change it. Anyone can tell you where luxury came from. We work with clients
      to shape where it’s headed: Luxury creative for real brands, with real
      results.





      And so, as we enter 2016 we plan to showcase what it can mean to rethink
      luxury across every medium - our client work, our own brand and our
      interactions with the world.
