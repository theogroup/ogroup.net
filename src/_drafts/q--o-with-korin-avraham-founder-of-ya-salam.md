      **Orit:**&nbsp;Who is Korin Avraham?





      **Korin:**&nbsp;I am a very passionate person; I love life, and eating it
      in big mouthful bites. I'm always looking for the zen between adventures.Ya
      Salam today is not "just" a blog, it's a full-time business that combines
      my being a strategic advisor for digital marketing and social networks with
      being an international brand ambassador. Which presents an opportunity for
      me to do what I love- traveling the world covering the most fun,
      fashionable and some luxury events. So Korin is also an extremely grateful
      person for all of that.





      **Orit:**&nbsp;From lawyer to fashion blogger, tell us more about how that
      came about.





      **Kori:**&nbsp;It wasn't an easy decision... But it felt like the right
      one.





      As soon as I could speak, everyone said I should be a lawyer; I was very
      vocal and always defended those being bullied. Seeking higher education was
      not negotiable. I graduated with a master’s degree in law and finance and
      start working as a litigator. I loved it and was good at it, but as time
      went on I felt like my soul was dimming. After looking for a meaning,
      I launched my blog with the understanding that I would still be working
      hard but doing what I love and allowing my work to be my expression.





      **Orit:**&nbsp;When you decided to blog about your love of fashion and
      travel did you think you would be the #1 bloggers to watch, and recognized
      in publications like Italian Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and many more?





      **Korin:**&nbsp;It happened 5 years ago, and I simply started it because it
      felt right. Turning it into a business and the worldwide recognition that
      came along with it, I didn't plan, I don't think you can. It's a response
      to something you create and it must be organic. But I'm super honored!





      **Orit:**&nbsp;To date what was your favorite campaign you have done and
      why?





      **Korin:&nbsp;**Oh! That's such a hard question! I won't be able to name
      just one but I'll say that, my latest trip to Marrakech with Clinique was
      such a magical experience and part of my heart stayed there. The Pura Lopez
      winter 2016-2017 campaign was also such an amazing and flattering
      experience.





      **Orit:**&nbsp;What are your thoughts on where traditional luxury measures
      with up and coming designers and what do you see down the pipeline for
      traditional luxury brands?





      **Korin:**&nbsp;I think everything in life as well as luxury has to move,
      to change and be reborn- that for me is part of the meaning of life.
      Sometimes the rule, is rule breaking.





      I think that luxury will change by itself. A good example of that is how
      luxury brands are trying to close the gap between runway and retail.
      Another good example is the new direction Alessandro Michele, the 'not so
      new anymore' creative director, took Gucci (and many other brands). Taking
      the brand to a different story and view, from feminine and a bit
      conservative, to geek chic and romantic. With designs that have a vintage
      aroma, and kind of private collection feel. In my opinion it's part of the
      answer to how people buy expensive clothes today. The clothes need to say
      something about you, and when it's expensive, it better say you're an
      individual.





      **Orit:**&nbsp;What does Luxury mean to you?





      **Korin:**&nbsp;Luxury is a state of mind (coming soon!)





      **Orit:**&nbsp;Tell us what’s next?





      **Korin:**&nbsp;I'm so excited for my December adventures, I can't say much
      other than stay tuned!​
