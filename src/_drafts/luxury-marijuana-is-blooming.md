intro_markdown: 'The conversation around marijuana has changed dramatically over the last decade. Once widely considered a pastime reserved for unmotivated outcasts and burnouts, the current public perception paints a different picture. People from all walks of life now freely admit to indulging in marijuana, despite the stigma that stubbornly exists.​'

      As more states legalize the plant’s recreational use, entrepreneurs,
      investors and brands have begun to capitalize on this burgeoning industry.





      “From a branding perspective, the legal cannabis landscape is maturing
      incredibly fast,” says Denver-based Strategy Director Jacob Lake.
      “Traditional CPG marketers and designers are migrating to work on this
      burgeoning category and they’re bringing that elevated skillset to an
      industry that was previously pretty fly-by-night in terms of design and
      brand fundamentals.”





      Does this growing opportunity make sense for luxury brands? Yes, but not
      for every brand. The stigma associated with marijuana use certainly
      prevents many established, traditional luxury brands from throwing their
      hat into the ring. However, for less traditional luxury brands the
      opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to push the envelope could
      reap big benefits. An alternative to jumping into a contentious category
      with an established brand might be to create an offshoot brand. Offshoot
      brands can allow an established brand to safely capitalize on the growth of
      the industry by leveraging their branding expertise, while avoiding
      potential backlash from less progressive consumers.





      Some new entities have already begun paving the way for more luxury
      marijuana-focused brands to enter the space, and nearly every aspect of
      marijuana culture is experiencing some element of high-end branding.





      Combating stereotypes with design sensibilities borrowed from fashion
      retail, Silverpeak Apothecary in Aspen, Colorado, is demonstrating that the
      need for premium marijuana retail spaces is very real. Rich wood lines the
      walls and cases of the store, and its products are displayed in a way
      similar to how you would find handbags and accessories shown in a Soho
      shop.





      When it comes to edibles, a few brands have taken an upscale approach to
      their products. D&eacute;fonc&eacute; Choclatier, for instance, comes
      across as a high-end, luxury chocolate artisan. From its elegant packaging,
      to the flowery language the brand uses to describe its process and
      products, one might mistake the brand for being just another premium
      chocolate producer. Inside their gorgeous exterior, however,
      D&eacute;fonc&eacute;’s creations pack a marijuana boost.





      For those who prefer smoking, Aura is a brand that believes that smoking
      should look as elevated as the smoker feels. Their flagship product is
      designed first and foremost to deliver a quality smoking experience – an
      experience that just so happens to be delivered in a sleek, modern and
      fantastic looking vessel. And the list goes on. From marijuana-inspired
      designs gracing the runways of world-famous fashion designers, to
      vaporizing devices that appear to have been designed by Silicon Valley’s
      best and brightest, affluent marijuana consumers have more options at their
      disposal than ever before.





      “The cannabis industry is leading a soaring growth trajectory over the next
      10 years and I think it will find itself in a similar situation as the beer
      business has recently,” says Lake. “Ultimately, I think the luxury echelon
      of cannabis has a huge upside, as consumers seek new and exclusive products
      in this emerging market. We’re already seeing limited edition production
      runs, packaging and brand collaborations and even specific genetics or
      strains that are coveted for their rarity, potency or pedigree. As
      legalization continues, I think the high end opportunities are bountiful.”





      The key to success appears to be the utilization of cues that connote
      premium, but that don’t scream “reefer madness.” If the marijuana industry
      is going to continue to grow, it has a responsibility to demonstrate that
      these premium products help responsible consumers indulge responsibly,
      without sacrificing design aesthetics.​
