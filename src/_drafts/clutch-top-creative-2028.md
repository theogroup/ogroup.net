  As a branding agency with over 30 years specializing in the Luxury sector, we
  often get asked:&nbsp; “What does Luxury mean today?” and&nbsp; “How do luxury
  brands today differ from heritage luxury brands?”.&nbsp;


  What we have observed with our clients over the recent past (both start-ups
  and successful businesses needing look at rebrand) is that traditional luxury
  branding models are wearing thin (mostly) and are losing efficacy in today’s
  marketplace. Why? The luxury audience has evolved and the definition for what
  is considered luxury has evolved with them.&nbsp; No longer is the luxury
  consumer driven by consumption alone and this outdated buying habit has even
  become distasteful in the eyes the “enlightened”.&nbsp;


  We are in the middle of yet another economic and branding evolutionary shift:
  moving from an Experience Economy (where customers seek out and prefer
  enjoyable experiences over products) and entering a Transformational Economy
  (where experiences are elevated from mere enjoyment towards a preference for
  personal transformation). In this new economy, the consumer becomes the expert
  and authority - they are their own agents of change - their own brand that’s
  in a constant state of becoming. Luxury brands who want to maintain relevancy
  in this arena of transformation should consider exactly how their products and
  services can become vehicles for supporting their customers personal brand and
  enable individual and collective change.&nbsp;


  The continued rise and pervasiveness of brand marketing concepts like
  Sustainability, Flexibility, Responsibility, Transparency, Integrity and
  Authenticity have become the elevated standards in many industries,&nbsp;
  including Luxury. Through a wide variety of tactics and applications, New
  Luxury employs these “elevated” concepts to help become part of a upgraded
  brand landscape.&nbsp; Targeted and helpful programing and activations,
  uncovering strategic alliances and sponsorships, producing new forms of
  educational experiences and developing innovative product technologies are all
  employed as effective means in illustrating credibility with consumers
  today.&nbsp;


  Over the past few years, we have identified 6 specific strategies for Luxury
  business wishing to connect with an evolved consumer.&nbsp; Not all of these
  directions can be or should be adapted for every brand, but there are at least
  a few (for any business) that could be looked in an effort to participate in
  the New Luxury landscape. &nbsp;

      **Brand Value: Belonging&nbsp;**


      Being part of something larger then yourself and participating in a
      movement or collective effort is a powerful motivator for brand adoption.
      SOULCYCLE has done a great job on evolving a long standing fitness
      activity (spinning) and transforming a standard membership into becoming
      part of a tribe of like-minded participants - and sharing in the same
      collective and shared experience together.&nbsp; Gucci has a nod towards
      this strategy in their recent campaign that recalls 1960’s counter-culture
      visuals, product development and copy which has reflects a distinct
      anti-establishment resonance. &nbsp;

      ***Collective / Shared: A group that shares in a brand experience, product
      or service &nbsp;and the bonding that comes from the collective
      interaction before, during or after being shared. &nbsp;***

      **Access / Democratization&nbsp;**


      *Definition: Making a product or service more widely available - making
      your brand more accessible and obtainable for more people. &nbsp;*


      <br>**Brand Value: Connectivity &nbsp;**


      This strategy seems to be in direct opposition to the Luxury mentality -
      if you create products that are widely available to everyone, can you be
      considered a Luxury brand any longer?&nbsp; A great example of a
      thoughtful implementation that increases a brand value of connectivity at
      the same time as protecting a brand’s luxury credibility comes from the
      Hermes / Apple Watch collaboration. By introducing the Hermes brand to a
      new generation of potential brand advocates (at a much lower price point),
      both brands benefited by the association and alignment.&nbsp;

      **Ethical / Transparency&nbsp;**


      *Definition: Being honest and forthcoming about how products and services
      are made, where materials and manufacturing comes from and adopting
      ethical and sustainable business practices though the entire brand supply
      chain.&nbsp;*


      **Brand Value: Authenticity&nbsp;**


      One of the “oldest” and most established strategies for connecting with
      aware consumers is the area of ethical transparency and sustainability.
      There are many ways Luxury brands can be authentic with customers and
      improve the “feel-good” aspect to a purchase of products and
      services.&nbsp; DeBeers “Forever Mark” program has been wildly successful
      in addressing the ethical issues inside the diamond businesses problems
      with African sourcing and human rights issues. &nbsp;

      **On-Demand&nbsp;**


      *Definition: Making your products or services available faster and more
      readily than usual - allowing customers to come and go as they wish and
      letting them drive brand adoption to meet their lifestyle choices.&nbsp;*


      **Brand Value: Freedom&nbsp;**


      There has been a growing cultural shit away from ownership and towards
      on-demand use has been one of the largest global transformations (Uber,
      Lyft, Airbnb, etc.) in the past few decades - being adopted by mass and
      luxury brands alike. This approach is not easy to adopt for many
      businesses that already have a fixed product offering, but start-ups have
      been building their business offering around this strategy with great
      success - like private aviation brand JetSmarter which makes luxury
      transportation fluid and provides ultimate travel freedom.

      **Self-Actualization&nbsp;**


      *Definition: Helping to facilitate a customers self-improvement goals -
      physically, mentally, spiritually or professionally.&nbsp;*


      **Brand Value: Fulfillment &nbsp;**


      The self-improvement market has been on a steady climb for decades but the
      Luxury industry has recently become aware of how to leverage this trend
      within product and service offerings.&nbsp; Seabourn cruses have been
      offering some of the most luxurious experiences in the travel sector - but
      has started to add more wellness programing to their with their trips with
      their Wellness Cruises - entire journeys dedicated to personal fulfillment
      and self-actualization.&nbsp;

      **Customization&nbsp;**


      *Definition: Allowing for customers to customize or personalize a product
      or service and add their own “mark” of individuality and identity to the
      finished product or experience.&nbsp;*


      **Brand Value: Recognition &nbsp;&nbsp;**


      Not a new strategy for luxury brands but one that has been increasing in
      popularity over the past decade is this ability for consumers to place
      their own “brand mark” onto an existing luxury product.&nbsp; Not only
      does this strategy add additional engagement streams and touchpoints but
      it places the customer at the center of the brand experience and raises
      the level of personal recognition to a visibility rarely seen in the
      luxury market.&nbsp; Louis Vuitton’s Mon Monogram program is a good
      example of how this is done well and for them, very much on brand. &nbsp;


      The O Group has helped both luxury start-ups and well established business
      add, adjust or evolve their brand strategies to help them maintain and
      realize their relevancy for a new luxury consumer. Our motto, Rethink
      Luxury, has been the core of our branding practice for the past twenty
      years and we are excited about helping our clients navigate this latest
      evolution of the industry.&nbsp;
