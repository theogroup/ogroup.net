services_headline: What we do
services_text: 'We help brands develop a point of view, and create an emotional connection with people who value aesthetic and experience.'
branding_text: 'We live in a world where luxury, price and category are no longer directly related. Branding is built on a strategic foundation that provides the framework for targeted creative. It’s about a tightly woven brand experience exceeding expectations.'
campaigns_text: 'We form a nuanced understanding of a brand’s position in order to launch the latest campaign. Whether the ask is to build excitement around a new product launch or to disrupt a category with luxury-level creative, we love this type of work.'
special_projects_text: 'Sometimes we take on work that doesn’t quite fit into Branding or Campaigns. From a global spirits conglomerate who needs help rethinking category norms, to a start-up with big brand aspiration, we’d love to talk about your crazy idea.'
about_text_1: We think differently. We always have. About the development of strategy and creative. About client relationships. About luxury.
about_text_2: 'Founded in 1986, The O Group is an independently owned creative agency headquartered in New York City and Seattle. Our focus from the beginning has been to reimagine how luxury brands are shaped. Many people can identify where luxury came from. Our mission is to help shape where it’s headed. We do that by becoming true partners to our clients and helping them define a unique brand voice inside the ever-changing and growing marketplace.'
about_text_3: "Our highly strategic and creative teams work collaboratively with every client. We have developed a proven, results-oriented process that insures success and delivers work that inspires. We're a diverse group of foodies, design geeks, dog lovers, travelers, adventure seekers, professional good-timers and martini guzzlers."

  - name: Orit
    title: CEO / PARTNER / NYC
    team_image: /uploads/orit-osite.jpg
    bio_markdown: >-
      Orit is and Founder/CEO of the boutique branding and creative agency, The
      O Group. Headquartered in New York City with offices in Seattle, the agency
      has carved out a niche in the luxury space; working with stellar brands
      such as Salvatore Ferragamo, Moet Hennessy USA, Garrard, Diageo, Acqualina
      Resort and Spa, Lacoste, Godiva, and The Pierre Hotel.





      Beginning her career as a graphic designer, Orit moved from corporate
      communications at a major television network, to heading up design
      departments at a number of corporations ranging from entertainment, toys,
      publishing and consumer electronics. Feeling the urge to create something
      for herself, Orit founded The O Group in 1986, and hasn’t looked back.





      The agency’s success can also be attributed to its ability to continually
      evolve and transform itself based on market needs and staying relevant.
      Today, the focus is less on raising the luxury market as a whole, and more
      on giving all brands the ability to leverage luxury cues, regardless of
      their industry. This ability can only come from an expert who has decades
      of experience connecting with consumers.





      In her time away from the agency, Orit also works tirelessly in a variety
      of fields close to her heart, including student mentorship, women’s
      business and leadership, and fostering relationships with past, and
      current, clients and employees and partners.





      Orit also loves to spend time with her family, gardening, and entertaining
      at her lake house.
  - name: Daymon Bruck
    title: CCO / PARTNER / SEATTLE
    team_image: /uploads/day-osite.jpg
    bio_markdown: >-
      A branding expert with 30 years dedication to the craft of creative problem
      solving, Daymon is currently leading the West Coast office in Seattle for
      The O Group as Chief Creative Officer. His ongoing success in the field of
      creative development has produced award-winning materials for many
      brand-driven clients including Nike, Coca-Cola, IBM, GeneralMotors,
      Salvatore Ferragamo, Four Seasons Hotels, MIRAMAX films and The
      OprahWinfrey Network.





      Daymon’s approach to brand development is very straightforward: immerse
      himself in the client’s business and industry, then deliver strategic brand
      creative that produces meaningful results. With decades of experience as
      a brand strategist and his extensive history in digital and print creative
      platforms, he considers solving holistic communication challenges his most
      meaningful client collaborations.





      After a successful career with two of the top creative firms on the East
      Coast, Ogilvy in NYC and Mullen in Boston, Daymon returned to his hometown
      of Seattle in 2001 to work with the region’s best-known agencies, Cole
      & Weber and Hornall Anderson. In 2006, after 15 years as Creative Director
      in the large agency world, he launched his own brand consultancy practice
      and developed a client list with many iconic brands of the Northwest such
      as Starbucks, Microsoft, AT&T Wireless, the Space Needle, Chihuly Garden
      and Glass, DRY Soda, and the Seattle International Film Festival.





      Today, the result of a 25 year strong friendship and successful
      collaborative bond with Orit and her agency (Daymon was The O Group’s first
      Creative Director hire in 2001) the branding veterans boldly joined forces
      again in 2017, expanding The O Group NYC office to Seattle with a dedicated
      focus on a select client base that would provide the most rewarding
      collaborations for both partners.





      When not focused on client work, Daymon continues to experiment with
      a number of other hats including restauranteur, aromatherapist,
      photographer, cyclist and organic farmer.
